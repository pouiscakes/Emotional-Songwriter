'Cause I'm not fine at all
I remember the make-up running down your face
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
The pictures that you sent me they're still living in my phone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
And you'd never hear me say
No, I'm really not fine at all
'Cause I'm really not fine at all
We work too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don't swim, you'll drown
But don't move, honey
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
There's such a difference between us
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
I must have called a thousand times (thousand times)
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
Your intentions aren't to bother me
Somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen
How we plan to take over the planet
Who's always gossiping about her friends
Right next to the boy who's throwing up 'cause
Some girl's talking 'bout her haters
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
Yeah you can tell everybody
Stand up now and face the sun
I got all the answers to your questions
It's a thin line between love and hate
Is you really real or is you really fake
Go ahead and tell everybody what I'm saying y'all
No, please don't wake me now
No limits just epiphanies
I hear it calling outside my window
And these long long legs are damn near everywhere
And if I stay I might not leave alone
'Cause you don't want a liar
She gives you everything,
I need to be the one who takes you home
I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I know that this is my fault
They tell me I'm too young to understand
So wake me up when it's all over
But I don't have any plans
And the walls kept tumbling down
But if you close your eyes,
And if you close your eyes,
In your pose as the dust settled around us
Anytime someone mention your name
All I know is that you take me high
Cause I can't get you out my mind
Exactly why
You light me up inside
Whenever you're around
And people ask me how
Well you're the reason why
And I don't plan to let you go
And when the times get rough
Don't care what others say
If I got you I'm straight
Turn the radio up so the girl can sing right
Throw it on down
Get em up
Man, it's how them girls do it in the dirty south, yeah
All y'all get your drinks up high
You act so innocent now
'Cause you light up the path
I don't care if you do, ooh
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
Either that or drive to money mart to make the pickups
Don't make me kill one of the GOAT's for it
That's why I never ask for help
That I'm all these people listen to
I can see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften it
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
You used to call me on my cell phone
Call me on my cell phone
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
You got a reputation for yourself now
You and me we just don't get along
Wonder if you're rollin' up a backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
You should just be yourself
"I wish that I could be like the cool kids,
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in.
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids."
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids.
I wish that I could be like the cool kids,
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to get it.
Like the cool kids
Take aim and reload
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
Wish I'd have written it down
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
Times forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Of your ripped jeans
I swear it will get easier
Remember that with every piece of ya
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away
Hearing you whisper through the phone,
We wish they would disappear
If you love me
From your head to toe
Louder!
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
Now she's kissing my mouth
Can you feel it? All that I can hear is music from the back
If you love me come on get involved
'Cause I need something that can wash out the pain
It keeps me awake
These eyes sitting on the wall
They watch every move I make
I had to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
And I let you under my skin
Truth is that I never learn
Stop the haunting baby
Now, there's one in California who's been cursing my name
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave
They won't let go
You know that's how the story goes
'Cause we got the fire, and we're burning one hell of a something
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Burn burn burn burn (burn burn)
So they can't put it out, out, out
The kids are all wrong
The story's all off
The bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
I never meant for you to fix yourself
And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
I could scream forever
And I can’t get you out of my head
Put your, put your v-v-venom in me
You’ll find your way
Take me down the line
You write her name on it, spin your tires on it
And when it rains you get stuck on
Makes you wanna build a ten percent down white picket fence house on this dirt
You've mixed some sweat with it, taken a shovel to it
Ooh, I'd leave it all
Stop and believe
Why I should never make a change
Then all of this will go away
If you just say the words
Give me one good reason
They don't understand
If you take my hand
If the heavens ever did speak
"We were born sick," you heard them say it
If I'm a pagan of the good times
Get something shiny
This is hungry work
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Be the good girl you always have to be
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on,
The cold never bothered me anyway!
Can't get to me at all!
Here I stand
Let the storm rage on!
When the days are cold
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl
Don't wanna let you down
I wanna save that light
Unless you show me how
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
Enough to make my system blow
So just watchin' her blonde hair, sun burnt, stare at them, white caps rolling over
You stirrin' up dirty in the back of my mind
You keep on flirtin' cause you know that it's workin'
You stuck in my head girl writing the lines
We about to get a little tangled up right about now
So girl let's keep burnin' it down
Every time that you get undressed
Yeah the drums they swing low
Yeah the trumpets they go
They go
Violins whenever you're gone
Whenever you're gone
Trumpets when you're turning me on?
Turning me on
Angels every time that you moan?
Time that you moan
Every time (Every time) that you get undressed
It's too hard to sleep
And I can't take it no more
'Cause I gotta leave, yeah
Girl, you're the one I want to want me
And you whisper in my ear, "Baby, I'm yours."
What would I do without your smart mouth?
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
Love your curves and all your edges
Give your all to me
How many times do I have to tell you
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
Give me all of you
Risking it all, though it's hard
I give you all of me
When you nod your head yes
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
Better make up your mind
You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
You're overprotective when I'm leaving
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end
(You're so confusing baby)
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won't stop until you believe it
Don't you know that I could be that guy to heal it over time
No I won't fill your mind
With broken promises and wasted time
These arms of mine
Why don't you let me stop by?
If you wanna dance,
If you want it all
Boy, when you're with me
Your song
You're never gonna be unsatisfied
If you wanna dance
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
So I sit quietly, agree politely
I let you push me past the breaking point
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like a finger on a loaded gun
And my kiss on your lips
Doublewide Quick Stop, midnight T-top
Yellow dog school bus kickin' up red dust
Pickin' us up by a barbed wire fence
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots
Take her home and give her your jacket
In the blue bug zapper light
I've wasted time, I've wasted breath
I need to move, I need to fight
Don't delay
All my girls just keep on blowing up my phone
Go until they cut me off
In the noise
Put that song on replay
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to stop
Just ask anyone
I'd do anything with you anywhere
Cause, I don't dance
I don’t get no sleep, I don’t get no peace
Lord knows I’ve tried, I can’t get her off my mind
But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom
We crave a different kind of buzz.
You can call me queen Bee
But every song's like gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom.
We crave a different kind of buzz
They're in their finery
Their skin in craters like the moon
Kick the dust up
They're making that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights
Backin up a two lane road
Fill your cup up
And I got that music for your ear
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
If he would have played it just one more time
Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again
Why you gotta be so rude?
Don't you know I'm human too?
I'm gonna marry her anyway
Marry that girl
Marry her anyway
Yeah, no matter what you say
Why you gotta be so
Rude
I hate to do this, you leave no choice
Love me or hate me we will be boys
She will go anywhere I go
No matter what you say
Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk
All around the wind blows
I can smell your scent from miles
So what you trying to do to me
It's like we can't stop we're enemies
You can find other fish in the sea
I can still hear you making that sound
So if I run it's not enough
You're still in my head forever stuck
So you can do what you wanna do
I’m changing all of the stations
In your darkest times
The map that leads to you
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
And now I can’t get over you
No, I just can’t get over you
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
And all the right junk in all the right places
You know I won't be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll
So if that's what you're into, then go 'head and move along
No, I'm just playing, I know you think you're fat
Even when I'm acting crazy
After every fight
Why disagree?
Why, why disagree?
If you gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Don't have a dirty mind
Leave them burning and then you're gone
If you want it, take it
Tried to hide it, fake it
Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
'Cause I can't resist it no more
But I woke up every time
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
The land lord say your rent is late
Here I give you my phone number
Well, maybe it's the common curse
Maybe things get bad before they get worse
Who can't live up to what already done
Don't keep it just to figure it out
When it rains and pours, and then it runs out
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
And let everything hang loose
You took your time with the call,
Take me by my little hand
Touching you, touching me
touching you, god you're touching me
I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.
To win some or learn some.
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
So I won't hesitate
There's no need to complicate.
Put up a parking lot
Don't it always seem to go
Don't it always seem to go,
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees
Late last night I heard the screen door slam
Doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh
Stop
I'm too hot (hot damn) {hot damn}
Before we leave
Let me tell y'all a little something
If you freaky then own it
But your voice is too loud
You pick the insects off plants
Take only what you need from it
All I wanna do is be with you
How could every day something jumps in the way
To pay off all my taxes and feed the president
Don’t wanna be no one-night stand
How many things can I say to make you understand
This is what it sounds like
I wish I had some time just to kill today,
Try to keep my head above it as best I can.
So kick off your shoes and relax your feet
They say that miracles are never ceasin', and every single soul needs a little releasin'
You're the one I want to be with when the sun goes
That they're gonna throw it back to you
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
Because maybe
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
We can steal it.
Say Geronimo!
Bombs away,
Bombs away.
So it's here I stand,
Through the crashing sound.
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
Never start no static I just get it off my chest
Take a small example, take a tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity
Don't start a riot
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot
I took it right in my eye
Take another, I don't mind
I know they wind right back to you
Whistle past the graveyard
She don't need to make a fuss
Leave me a sign
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Let me take you past our satellites
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
Man, I swear I love her how she work the damn pole
Boy how far can your bands go?
Fetty Wap I'm living fifty thousand K how I stand though
Man, I swear I love her, how she work the damn pole
Put your money where your mouth is
Put up or shut up
And I gotta get one little taste
Your sugar
My broken pieces
You pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging
You are the one thing, one thing
Don't let nobody touch it
From you hear my voice it's no secret
Omi make me turn up the speaker
She's always right there when I need her
When I need motivation, my one solution
She's always in my corner right there when I want her
Do you need me
If it's wrong I don't care I'm a right this
Thinks you do have me flying the highest
Say whatever what you want call me like it
For the haters out there, you can bite this
Everywhere I go, got them off there singing like
She is always right there when I need her
All that's left to do is just for me to pop the question
You look like my next mistake
You can tell me when it's over
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
I can make all the tables turn
Keep you second guessing like
I get drunk on jealousy
Boys only want love if it's torture
Just keep your eyes on me."
This woman is my destiny
Shut up and dance with me."
Shut up and dance!"
I'm never confused
You're always worth it
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
And when you say you need me
We jumped never asking why
I will always want you
And instead of using force
Who can blame me
You're over my head
You're over my head I'm out of my mind
My feet can't touch the ground,
Every time you are not around
I hate the beach
But I stand
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
My Anaconda don't...
He keep telling me to chill
Because he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
(Don't don't don't) My Anaconda don't...
She takes 'til I break and I can't get more
Baby tell me why, why you do, do me wrong
I turn my chin music up
You can call me obsessed
It's not your fault that they hover
Protective or possessive, yeah
When you get jealous too
I ain't tryna do what everybody else doing
Just 'cause everybody doing what they all do
For trying to reach the things that I can't see?
Walk, walk, don't look back, always do what you decide
Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let them compare you, no
Trying to reach the things that I can't see
Baby you're my only reason
All these lights
Does it ever drive you crazy
Disappearing when you wake up
Heart is beating loud, and she doesn't want it to stop
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
In my face is flashing signs,
And I feel it burn down this river every time
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down,
Oh, we all want the same thing.
For love, for hate,
But just give it time
You are what they're feeding on
So what are you gonna do when the world don't orbit around you?
Well, you can ring anybody's bell to get what you want
You see, it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're living in a bubble
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Well you see her when you fall asleep
Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Like how a single word
I will scream them loud tonight
Can you hear my voice this time?
This is my fight song
My power's turned on
Yeah...
I try to run away but your eyes
Tell me to stay, oh why,
When I say
Maybe some part of you just hates me
You pick me up and play me
You're on the couch, blowing up my phone
It don't take but two to have a little soirée
If you're in the mood to sit tight right where you are, babe
Turn your TV off, break that boom-box out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down
If you're gonna be a homebody
If you wanna be a homebody
Throw a neon tee shirt over the lamp shade
I can't sleep with you on my brain
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
I'm wishin' for it too
Nobody cares how fast we go
And I don't mean to bother you but
Your eyes are so intimidating
It's just a conversation
No, girl I'm not wasted
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I just wanna take your time
I ain't gonna waste my lines
And the next thing you know you're trying to be nice
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
You could've rolled your eyes
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
You've been so unavailable
Maybe I am just not enough
Your touch, your skin
No words can explain
They tell their own story
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?
'Cause you're all I need
Why am I so emotional?
You can turn a phrase into a weapon or a drug
You can be the outcast
When they settle 'neath your skin
Say what you wanna say
With what you want to say
Don't run, just stop holding your tongue
Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live
Maybe one of these days you can let the light in
Why don't you tell them the truth?
I can't compare to nothing
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
And every second's like torture
If I quit calling you my lover
Gotta get you out of my head
Gotta get you out of my head, get you out of my head
Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn
Phone's blowin' up, ringin' my doorbell
Like it doesn't exist
And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love?
Now another one bites the dust
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
Then another one bites the dust
Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted
And time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
If you love like that blood runs cold
I stay out too late
But I can't make them stay
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world,
You could've been getting down to this sick beat.
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Takes me home
Can't stop thinking about you," and I...
Even if it's just in your
And his voice is a familiar sound,
My last request is
Someday when you leave me
Follow you around
Even if it's just pretend
The feeling of your skin locked in my head
Smoke, smoke me broke
Wanna keep you here
How it is for us
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right
Lips, lips I kiss
Bite me while I taste your fingertips
Let's use them up 'til every little piece is gone
Why you gotta act so naughty
Everybody say it like
Everybody say
All the problems you done had, yeah
Finna give you something that you won't forget
Baby, I just wanna get you out them clothes
Slow motion
In slow motion
Go and put this joint between your lips
Baby, why don't you make yourself comfortable
While I go and put this tongue on you
I'ma speed it up for you just for a second,
Then I'ma slow it back down and keep it steady
Now that you are out them clothes
Oh darling, I just wanna get you out them clothes
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
And I got a lump in my throat 'cause
Renegades, renegades
So, all hail the underdogs
All hail the outlaws
Colors are everywhere around us!
