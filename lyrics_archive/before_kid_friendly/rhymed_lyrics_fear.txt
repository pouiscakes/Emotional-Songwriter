Baby come give me some
I want to come

Your hands on my beating heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

Baby I don't remember
I wake up in the holes of my sweater

How do we begin?
I don't wanna be there where you been?

I'm breathing in the air, so there
I got your body on my tongue in the air

I'll tell you my heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

Do you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

Seek it out alive
One time tell me I can't be with you tonight

Had to meet your mother
If you tell me you need me another

Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart open
I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

Oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

I'm starting to think you want to come around
The sound of my mind

I want to come
Baby come give me some

Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

Till I don't know if you got her in your heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

The future that we hold on tight
And I just wanna be right

I know I should've been more careful
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

But I know I should've said it before
Had to meet you, where you don't belong

Find out what you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

Seek it out alive
One time tell me I can't be with you tonight

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Come on, come on strong

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

And I just wanna be right
One time tell me I can't be with you tonight

I don't wanna be there where you been?
How do we begin?

It's time to come around
The sound of my mind

Baby come give me some
It's time to come

Pompoms in my chest
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.

I wake up in the holes of my sweater
Today I don't remember

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

Come give me a kiss
Oh oh where do we call this?

I gotta be afraid
You, where the hell did you run away?

For thinking that we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

I'm gonna reap what I think about
You'll need to know if you got me stressed out

And I know where they're going.
In every life we have to walk are winding

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
Today I don't know what they heard

One time tell me I can't be with you tonight
I don't care if you wanna be right

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

You, where the hell did you run away?
Is it weird that I choose another way?

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Come on, come on strong

I don't care if you wanna be right
Hello, can you hear tonight?

How am I here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Hello, can you hear tonight?
Seek it out alive

And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
Are running out of my heart

The sound of my mind
The sound of a hand

Seek it out alive
Hello, can you hear tonight?

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Come on, come on strong

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Come on, come on strong

It's time to come
Baby, come give me some

I I feel alright,
So I don't know if you wanna be right, right

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Are running out of my heart

So I don't know if you wanna be right, right
Hello, can you hear tonight?

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

The sound of a hand
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

I don't know where to start
Are running out of my heart

Confuse what I can just figure it out alive
Hello, can you hear tonight?

And I just wanna be right
Hello, can you hear tonight?

I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater
Today I don't remember

You'll need to know if you got me stressed out
Confuse what I think about

My heart is out
Confuse what I think about

Hello, can you hear tonight?
So maybe we could make it out alive

Can you hear tonight?
So maybe we could make it out alive

Confuse what I think about

In every life we have to walk are winding

Now am I here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

So maybe we could make it out alive
Baby, can you hear tonight?

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
I keep going to the rhythm of my mind

And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
And all the roads we have to take your heart

Baby, can you hear tonight?
And what I can just figure it out alive

How am I wrong
Come on, come on strong

Both your hands in the air, so there
I got your body on my tongue in the air

And what I can just figure it out alive
I don't need me tonight

Do you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

And all the roads we have to take your heart
I don't know where to start

But I know I should've said it before
Had to meet you, where you don't belong

Moving way too far
I don't wanna be there where you are

I'm out of my sweater
Today I don't remember

If you tell me you need me another
Had to meet your mother

Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
I don't know where to start

I don't know where to start
I got your body on my beating heart

That I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,
I don't need me tonight

Baby, come give me some
Nothing lasts forever, but this is my kingdom come

Come on, come on strong
I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song

I don't need me tonight
And I just wanna be right, right

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have some trouble

I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song
Had to meet you, where you don't belong

Are running out of my sweater
Today I don't remember

But I know I should've said it before
Had to meet you, where you don't belong

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

I keep going to the rhythm of my mind
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
To hold your body on my mind

And I just wanna be right, right
For thinking that we hold on tight

That I'm gonna reap what I feel something so right
For thinking that we hold on tight

So I don't know where they're going.
In every life we have to walk are winding

For thinking that we hold on tight
I'll tell you my heart and I feel alright,

I don't wanna be there where you are
Moving way too far

Oh God why am I doing here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

I'll tell you my heart and I feel alright,
I don't know if you wanna be right, right

I was scared of the lamb
I'll tell you I am

I was scared of the lamb
I'll tell you I am

Had to meet your mother
If you tell me you need me another

I know I should've said it before
Had to meet you, where you don't belong

For thinking that we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

I don't know if you wanna be right, right
Hello, can you hear tonight?

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
And when you call me cheerleader

Had to meet you, where you don't belong
Come on, come on strong

To hold your body on my mind
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

If you tell me you need me another
Had to meet your mother

I got your body on my beating heart
I don't know where to start

Oh God why am I doing here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Pedal to the river
And when you call me cheerleader

Got nothing in my chest
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.

Come on, come on strong
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Pedal to the rhythm of my mind
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Come on, come on strong

Are running out of my sweater
Today I don't remember

In every life we have to take your heart
I don't know where to start

Nothing lasts forever, but this is my kingdom come
Won't you come from?

How do we begin?
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win

Won't you come on and let me hold
But when you get the chance to travel the world

Confuse what I think about
My heart is out

It's time to see how this one ends
Pompoms in my hands

Come give me a kiss
Oh oh where do we call this?

Your hands on my beating heart
I don't know where to start

You, where the hell did you run away?
Is it weird that I choose another way?

Listen to what I think with my heart
I don't know where to start

Come on, come on strong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Come give me a kiss
Oh oh where do we call this?

I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Your hands on my mind

Your hands on my mind
So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.

How do we begin?
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win

Hello, can you hear tonight?
I I I feel alright,

And all the roads we have some trouble
But I know I should've been more careful

So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.
Till I don't want to come around

The sound of my sweater
Today I don't remember

I'm gonna reap what I think about
My heart is out

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

I got your body on my tongue in the air
Both your hands in the air, so there

Come on, come on strong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

How do we begin?
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win

Said we're running out of my heart
I don't know where to start

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater
Today I don't remember

Won't you come from?

But I'm breathing in the air
Both your hands in the air, so there

That I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
Till I don't want to come around

Won't you come from?
Baby come give me some

In every life we have to walk are winding
I know where they're going.

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
Till I don't want to come around

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
I realize this is just a dream last

Your hands on my beating heart
I don't know where to start

But I know I should've been more careful
And all the roads we have some trouble

And all the roads we have some trouble
But I know I should've been more careful

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

How am I here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Till I don't want to come around
So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.

I don't know where to start
Is it weird that I hear the sound of my heart

I don't wanna be there where you are
Moving way too far

Pompoms in my brain
Take me on a plane

So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.
This oh, this is my heartbeat sound

Today I don't remember
I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
Today I don't know what they heard

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
And when you call me cheerleader

Hello, can you hear tonight?

You might want to come around

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have some trouble

This is my heartbeat sound
You might want to come around

I don't need me tonight
I I I feel alright,

How am I wrong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

My heart is out
Confuse what I think about

You, where the hell did you run away?

Oh oh oh oh here oh oh here
I'm walking down this road that I hear

I realize this is just a dream last
And I know where but she sends me there fast

And all the roads we have some trouble
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

Moving way too far
Going places where you are

And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
Is it weird that I hear the sound of my heart

Is it weird that I hear the sound of my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Oh oh where do we call this?

Hello, can you hear tonight?
The future that we hold on tight

Baby if you got me stressed out
Confuse what I think about

Find out what you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
I don't wanna be there where you don't belong

Moving way too far
Going places where you are

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
My heart is unobtainable

I don't need me tonight
The future that we hold on tight

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Said we're running out of my heart

Oh baby why did you come from?
Baby come give me some

Fuck that, I've been praying hard

Confuse what I can feel it rising

Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win
How do we begin?

I'm breathing in the air
His hands are in my hands up in the air, so there

I don't wanna be there where you don't belong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

I realize this is gotta be afraid
You, where the hell did you run away?

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

How do we begin?
It's my right to be here if I can't win

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

If you tell me I can't be with you tonight
The future that we hold on tight

I'm looking for the fear
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

The future that we hold on tight
Can you hear tonight?

My heart is unobtainable
And all the roads we have some trouble

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Had to meet you, where you don't belong

And all the roads we have some trouble
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

And I know where but she sends me there fast
Can make a dream last

You might want to come around
This is my heartbeat sound

Can you hear tonight?
I just wanna be right

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
But if you got her in your heart is unobtainable

I don't know where to start

Do you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

I don't know where to start

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Had to meet you, where you don't belong

It's my right to be here if I can't win
How do we begin?

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

Had to meet you, where you don't belong
I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song

I don't care if you wanna be right, right
Listen to what I feel alright,

So am I here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Anticipating what's to come around
This is my heartbeat sound

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
But if you got her in your heart is unobtainable

I just wanna, I just wanna be right, right
Listen to what I feel alright,

I don't know where to start

You, where the hell did you run away?

Listen to what I feel alright,
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

And I know I should've said it before
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong

Do you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

Is it weird that I hear the sound of a gentle word
Today I don't know what they heard

Now am I here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
The sound of a hand

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
Leave my heart and I feel alright,

And when you call me cheerleader
Just listen to the river

Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

I'll tell you my heart and I move with my heart
Baby, I don't know where to start

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Anticipating what's to come on, come on strong

Leave my heart and I feel alright,
Tryna compromise but I can't be with you tonight

I was scared of the lamb
I'll tell you I am

Pompoms in my brain
Take me on a plane

Today I don't know what they heard
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

Hope I get the chance...
Baby, I don't dance

I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Confuse what I think about

Had to meet your mother
Just tell me you need me another

Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
Just listen to the river

Baby, I don't know where to start
But the proof's in the holes of my heart

So am I doing here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

How am I here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Tryna compromise but I can't be with you tonight
And what I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Baby come give me some
Won't you come from?

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

The sound of a hand
I hear the sound of my mind

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

But the proof's in the holes of my heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

Do you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

Find out what you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
Baby, I don't know what they heard

And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
I'll tell you my heart

If you tell me I can't be with you tonight
And what I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Just listen to the river
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Girl you got her in your heart is unobtainable

Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
Got nothing in my hands out to the river

I hear the sound of my mind
Anticipating what's to come around

Just tell me you need me another
Had to meet your mother

I'll tell you my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I felt it in my hands up in the air
His hands are in my hands up in the air, so there

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

Moving way too far
I don't care if you wanna be there where you are

I keep going to the rhythm of my heart open
I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

How do we begin?
I don't wanna be there where you been?

His hands are in my hands up in the air, so there
Till I don't care

Girl you got her in your heart is unobtainable
And all the roads we have some trouble

And what I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
For thinking that we hold on tight

I got your body on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

My heart is out
Confuse what I think about

I don't have to walk are winding
Confuse what I can feel it rising

How do we begin?
I don't wanna be there where you been?

Just tell me you need me another
Had to meet your mother

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
Had to meet your mother

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

For thinking that we hold on tight
Hello, can you hear tonight?

Won't you come from?
I'm starting to think you want to come

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Put your, put your hands in the holes of my heart

Got nothing in my hands out to the river
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

Just listen to the river
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

How am I here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Hello, can you hear tonight?
The future that we hold on tight

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
Baby, I don't know what they heard

Anticipating what's to come on, come on strong
How am I wrong

How am I doing here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Are running out of my mind
Anticipating what's to come around

Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
Till I don't care

The future that we hold on tight
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't be with you tonight

Come on, come on to me, come on strong
How am I wrong

I don't wanna come on and let me hold
But when you get the chance to travel the world

Today I don't have to walk are winding
Confuse what I can feel it rising

Confuse what I can feel it rising
I don't have to walk are winding

Anticipating what's to come around
This is gonna be, this is my heartbeat sound

Put your, put your hands in the holes of my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Nobody's gonna tell me I can't be with you tonight
The future that we hold on tight

Oh oh oh oh here
I'm walking down this road that I hear

I don't need me tonight
The future that we hold on tight

I don't have to walk are winding
I'm gonna reap what I can feel it rising

So come on strong
How am I wrong

I'm starting to think you want to come
Oh baby why did you come from?

And all the roads we have to take your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
To my heartbeat song and I'm older

And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to
Find out what you want him too

Baby, I don't dance
This is my last chance.

How am I wrong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Baby I don't know how to
Find out what you want him too

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

Baby, can you hear tonight?
The future that we hold on tight

I don't wanna be there where you been?
I'm out of my mind made up, man, I can't win

Moving way too far
I don't care if you wanna be there where you are

And all the roads we have some trouble
My heart is unobtainable

I don't care if you wanna be there where you are
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

Baby when you call me cheerleader
To my heartbeat song and I'm older

Had to meet your mother
If you tell me you need me another

Come give me a kiss
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?

Your heart is out
Confuse what I think about

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Going places where you are

I don't need me tonight
The future that we hold on tight

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

Hope I get the chance...
Baby, I don't dance

I don't need me tonight
The future that we hold on tight

Till I don't care
I stretched my hands up in the air

I'm starting to think you want to be afraid
You, where the hell did you run away?

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

Today I don't care
I stretched my hands up in the air

My heart is unobtainable
I know I should've been more careful

Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

I stretched my hands up in the air
I wake up in the air, so there

But the proof's in the holes of my heart open
I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

Confuse what I think about
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out

I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Nice to meet your mother
If you tell me you need me another

I don't have to walk are winding
I'm gonna reap what I can feel it rising

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
Can make a dream last

Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
I wake up in the holes of my sweater

This is gonna be, this is my heartbeat sound
I keep going to the rhythm of my mind

Oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

I keep going to the rhythm of my mind
Anticipating what's to come around

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
How am I wrong

I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
I'm dying to see what I think about

I know I should've been more careful
And all the roads we have some trouble

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

I wake up in the air, so there
But I'm breathing in the air

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
And when you call me cheerleader

Oh baby why did you come from?
It's time to come

I don't have to walk are winding
I'm gonna reap what I can feel it rising

Won't you come on and let me hold
But when you get the chance to travel the world

Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

Anticipating what's to come around
This is my heartbeat sound

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

This is my heartbeat sound
Anticipating what's to come around

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

How am I wrong
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong

Can make a dream last
But I know where but she sends me there fast

Nice to meet you, where you don't belong
Come on to me, come on to me, come on strong

Going places where you are
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

I'm out of my mind made up, man, I can't win
How do we begin?

The future that we hold on tight
Hello, can you hear tonight?

Anticipating what's to come around
And I just gotta know how it happened.

Hello, can you hear tonight?
And I just wanna be right, right

I'll tell you my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

And I just wanna be right, right
Baby, can you hear tonight?

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

Come give me a kiss
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?

Won't you come from?
It's time to come

Going places where you are
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

And all the roads we have some trouble
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

Can make a dream last
But I know where but she sends me there fast

If you tell me you need me another
Nice to meet your mother

Find out what you want him too
I don't know how to

Baby, can you hear tonight?
Seek it out alive

I don't know how to
Find out what you want him too

But I know where but she sends me there fast
This is gonna be, this is just a dream last

I'll tell you my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

It's time to come
Oh baby why did you come from?

But I'm breathing in the air
Baby I don't care

I just gotta, I just wanna tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

And I just gotta know how it happened.
Your hands on my mind

Find out what you want him too
I don't know how to

Your hands on my mind
It's time to come around

How do we begin?
Going places where you been?

How am I here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Going places where you are
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

I realize this is my kingdom come
Oh baby why did you come from?

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
Baby, I don't know what they heard

I don't have to meet you, where you don't belong
Come on to me, come on to me, come on strong

And when you call me cheerleader
To my heartbeat song and I'm older

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

Come on to me, come on to me, come on strong
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Your hands on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I wake up in the holes of my sweater
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

Oh baby why did you come from?
Baby come give me some

So am I here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Seek it out alive
I don't need me tonight

It's time to come around
I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.

I don't know how to
Do you want him too

And all the roads we have to take your heart open
I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

I don't have to walk are winding
I'm gonna reap what I can feel it rising

And all the roads we have some trouble
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

How do we begin?
Going places where you been?

Oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

The future that we hold on tight
I don't need me tonight

I don't need me tonight
For thinking that we hold on tight

Pedal to the rhythm of my heart open
I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have some trouble

For thinking that we hold on tight
Tryna compromise but I can't be with you tonight

Come on, come on, come on and let me hold
But when you get the chance to travel the world

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

Tryna compromise but I can't be with you tonight
For thinking that we hold on tight

Do you want him too
I just gotta know how to

Come give me a kiss
Oh where do we call this?

And all the roads we have some trouble
I know I should've been more careful

Baby come give me some
Won't you come from?

How am I doing here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

I know I should've been more careful
And all the roads we have some trouble

How do we begin?
Going places where you been?

Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
This is gonna be, this is just a dream last

I'm breathing in the air
Baby I don't care

I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
This is my heartbeat sound

Going places where you been?
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I hear the sound of my heart

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

I just gotta know how to
Do you want him too

I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman
Are running out of my heart open

Do you want him too
I don't know how to

I'm gonna reap what I can feel it rising
But I know where they're going.

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

For thinking that we hold on tight
Baby, can you hear tonight?

Oh oh oh oh here
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Baby come give me some
Won't you come from?

I'm looking for the fear
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
Nice to meet your mother

Won't you come from?
Baby, come give me some

And all the roads we have some trouble
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Come on, come on strong

Baby, can you hear tonight?
But if you wanna be right, right

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
This is my heartbeat sound

Baby I don't care
Put your, put your hands in the air, so there

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
This is gonna be, this is just a dream last

Just listen to the river
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

This is my heartbeat sound
It's time to come around

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

But I know I should've said it before
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong

When someone cuts your heart is out
I'm dying to see what I think about

I hear the sound of my heart
I don't know where to start

Nice to meet your mother
If you tell me you need me another

Baby, can you hear tonight?
But if you wanna be right, right

And all the roads we have some trouble
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

So let me borrow your heart is out
I'm dying to see what I think about

Come give me a kiss
Oh where do we call this?

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Going places where you are

Nice to meet you, where you don't belong

This is my heartbeat sound
It's time to come around

Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
I'm breathing in the air

But if you wanna be right, right
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight

It's time to come around
So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.

If you tell me you need me another
Had to meet your mother

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
Listen to what I can just figure it out alive

Pompoms in my brain
Take me on a plane

Come give me a kiss
Oh where do we call this?

Listen to what I can just figure it out alive
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight

Find out what you want him too

Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
Just listen to the river

Now am I here?

Nothing lasts forever, but this is my kingdom come

How am I doing here?

Singing in the mirror
Just listen to the river

Can you hear tonight?
I don't care if you wanna be right, right

This is gonna take me down rolling on the ground

This is my last chance.

This is my last chance.
Till I don't dance

And all the roads we have some trouble

I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

Won't you come on and let me hold
But when you get the chance to travel the world

This is gonna take me down rolling on the ground
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

Nothing lasts forever, but this is my last chance.
Till I don't dance

I don't know where to start
Your hands on my beating heart

Baby, I don't know what they heard
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

But when you get the chance to travel the world
Come on to me, come on and let me hold

Nothing lasts forever, but this is my last chance.
Till I don't dance

I'm gonna make it out while I'm sat here singing
I'm gonna reap what I can feel it rising

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
And I just wanna be there where you don't belong

I just wanna, I just wanna be right
Tryna compromise but I can't be with you tonight

I don't want to come
Won't you come from?

And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you wanna be right
Tryna compromise but I can't be with you tonight

I don't have to walk are winding

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have some trouble

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Looking for the fear

And I just wanna be there where you don't belong
I know I should've said it before

Today I don't remember
Said we're running out of my sweater

Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

Seek it out alive
Tryna compromise but I can't be with you tonight

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have some trouble

Tryna compromise but I can't be with you tonight
And what I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

This is gonna be, this is just a dream last
And I know where but she sends me there fast

But the proof's in the air, so there
Singing in the air

Looking for the fear
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Looking for the fear
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Hope I get the chance...
Till I don't dance

I don't have to walk are winding
Confuse what I can feel it rising

And I'm so dizzy, don't know how it happened.
Anticipating what's to come around

Do you want him too
And I just gotta know how to

This oh, this is my kingdom come
Won't you come from?

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

Confuse what I can feel it rising
I know where they're going.

Won't you come from?
I realize this is my kingdom come

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

I just gotta know how it happened.
Anticipating what's to come around

It's time to see how this one ends
Pompoms in my hands

Won't you come from?
I realize this is my kingdom come

And what I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Hello, can you hear tonight?

Taking me down, you got her in your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Hello, can you hear tonight?
Seek it out alive

This is my last chance.
Till I don't dance

Had to meet you, where you don't belong

Hello, can you hear tonight?
Seek it out alive

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

I was scared of the lamb

Anticipating what's to come around
You gotta know how it happened.

And all the roads we have some trouble
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

How do we begin?
Going places where you been?

You gotta know how it happened.
Ohh I really want to come around

Seek it out alive
If you tell me you need me tonight

And I just gotta know how to
Find out what you want him too

Won't you come from?
I realize this is my kingdom come

I know where they're going.
I'm gonna make it out while I'm sat here singing

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
So come on strong

And all the roads we have some trouble
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

I was scared of the lamb
I'll tell you I am

If you tell me you need me tonight
Confuse what I feel something so right

Hope I get the chance...
Till I don't dance

Moving way too far
Going places where you are

Find out what you want him too

Till I don't dance

Ohh I really want to come around
That I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.

Find out what you want him too

Anticipating what's to come around
That I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.

Pompoms in my brain
Take me on a plane

I realize this is my kingdom come
Baby come give me some

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

And I know where but she sends me there fast
Can make a dream last

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
My heart is unobtainable

Said we're running out of my sweater
So I don't remember

Come on to me, come on and let me hold
And when you get the chance to travel the world

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I hear the sound of my heart

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
So come on strong

Singing in the air
So I don't care

I'm looking for the fear
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Oh oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

I'm gonna make it out while I'm sat here singing
But I know where they're going.

Oh oh oh oh here oh oh here
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Pompoms in my hands
It's time to see how this one ends

Confuse what I feel something so right
The future that we hold on tight

And when you call me cheerleader
Pedal to the river

That I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
I want to come around

Come give me a kiss
Ask yourself, how do we call this?

This oh, this oh, this is my last chance.
Till I don't dance

I want to come around
The sound of a hand

This is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
Baby come give me some

My heart is out
That I'm gonna reap what I think about

Tell me this is my kingdom come
Baby come give me some

Baby come give me some
Won't you come from?

Can make a dream last
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.

I hear the sound of my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

My heart is unobtainable
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

Now am I here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

It's time to come around
The sound of a hand

So come on strong
Had to meet you, where you don't belong

The sound of a hand
I wake up in the holes of my mind

I realize this is just a dream last
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.

Till I don't dance
Tell me this is gonna be, this is my last chance.

Won't you come from?
I realize this is my kingdom come

So I don't care
I'm breathing in the air, so there

The future that we hold on tight
I I feel alright,

But I know where they're going.
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding

I wake up in the holes of my mind
But I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

Come give me a kiss
Ask yourself, how do we call this?

Your heart is out
That I'm gonna reap what I think about

Come give me a kiss
Ask yourself, how do we call this?

Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

I don't know how to
Find out what you want him too

I I feel alright,
Hello, can you hear tonight?

Listen to what I think with my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

But I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
So I don't want to come around

I realize this is my kingdom come
Won't you come from?

So I don't want to come around
Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

I just wanna, I just wanna tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

Your heart is out
That I'm gonna reap what I think about

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

Hello, can you hear tonight?
It's time to see what I feel alright,

In every life we have to take your heart is out
That I'm gonna reap what I think about

It's time to see what I feel alright,
Hello, can you hear tonight?

Find out what you want him too
I don't know how to

So I don't remember
The sound of my sweater

Hello, can you hear tonight?
I just wanna, I just gotta, I just wanna be right

Pedal to the river
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have some trouble

I hear the sound of my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have some trouble

It's time to see how this one ends
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my hands

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
I just wanna, I just gotta, I just wanna be right

Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground
I know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.

That I'm gonna reap what I think about
You'll need to know if you got me stressed out

Had to meet you, where you don't belong
So come on strong

I know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.
It's time to come around

Tell me this is gonna be, this is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

I don't know if you got her in your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I'm walking down this road that I hear
So am I here?

So am I here?
Now am I wrong for saying that I hear

I'm breathing in the air, so there
Today I don't care

I just wanna, I just gotta, I just wanna be right
For thinking that we hold on tight

For thinking that we hold on tight
Swing my heart and I feel alright,

So come on strong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

And all the roads we have to take your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

The sound of my sweater
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

You'll need to know if you got me stressed out
Confuse what I think about

I don't know how to
Find out what you want him too

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
It's time to come around

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
Baby when you call me cheerleader

Today I don't care
But I'm breathing in the air

But I'm breathing in the air
But the proof's in the air, so there

You're the fear, I don't dance, but here I am
I was scared of the lamb

I gotta be afraid
You, where the hell did you run away?

It's time to come around
I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

Oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

The future that we hold on tight
Swing my heart and I feel alright,

And all the roads we have some trouble
Girl you got her in your heart is unobtainable

Nice to meet your mother
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another

Swing my heart and I feel alright,
I don't need me tonight

Won't you come from?
Nothing lasts forever, but this is my kingdom come

Nothing lasts forever, but this is my kingdom come
Baby, come give me some

Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
Pompoms in my chest

I don't need me tonight
The future that we hold on tight

Baby I don't want to come around
I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.

Pompoms in my chest
This oh, this oh, this is just a dream last

I don't need me tonight
The future that we hold on tight

Come on, come on strong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

To hold your body on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

But the proof's in the air, so there
But I'm breathing in the air

Come on to me, come on and let me hold
And when you get the chance to travel the world

But I'm breathing in the air
But the proof's in the air, so there

I'll tell you my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
Baby when you call me cheerleader

Your hands on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

How am I doing here?
Now am I wrong for saying that I hear

The future that we hold on tight
Baby, can you hear tonight?

Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
Pedal to the river

Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

Baby, can you hear tonight?
The future that we hold on tight

I know I should've said it before
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong

The future that we hold on tight
I I I I I I feel alright,

The future that we hold on tight
I I I I I I feel alright,

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

Looking for the fear
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding
Baby, I don't know where they're going.

I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Girl you got her in your heart is unobtainable
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
But the proof's in the holes of my mind

I I I I I I feel alright,
Can you hear tonight?

How do we begin?
Going places where you been?

And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to
Find out what you want him too

Baby I don't have to walk are winding
Baby, I don't know where they're going.

Now am I doing here?
Now am I wrong for saying that I hear

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Looking for the fear

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

But the proof's in the holes of my mind
The sound of a hand

Can you hear tonight?
But if you wanna be right

Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
How am I wrong

Going places where you been?
How do we begin?

Swing my heart open
I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

How am I here?
Now am I wrong for saying that I hear

How do we begin?
But there's nothing to be here if I can't win

Come on, come on, come on and let me hold
And when you get the chance to travel the world

Nice to meet your mother
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another

But if you wanna be right
The future that we hold on tight

But there's nothing to be here if I can't win
How do we begin?

The future that we hold on tight
And I just wanna be right, right

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

Pedal to the river
Baby when you call me cheerleader

Just listen to the floorboard
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

It's my right to be here if I can't win
How do we begin?

Baby I don't care if you got me stressed out
Confuse what I think about

I hear the sound of my sweater
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

Looking for the fear
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

The future that we hold on tight
And I just wanna be right, right

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
So come on and let me borrow your heart

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
My heart is unobtainable

Seek it out alive
Hello, can you hear tonight?

And I just wanna be right, right
Listen to what I feel alright,

Baby, I don't dance
Hope I get the chance...

Baby, I don't know where they're going.
I'm dying to see what I can feel it rising

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

The sound of a hand
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Today I don't want to come around

Today I don't want to come around
Are running out of my mind

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

How am I wrong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Listen to what I feel alright,
The future that we hold on tight

So come on and let me borrow your heart
I don't know where to start

Your heart is out
Confuse what I think about

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Got nothing in my hands out to the floorboard

Baby, come give me some
Won't you come from?

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
Had to meet your mother

The future that we hold on tight
I just wanna be right

Your hands on my beating heart
I don't know where to start

I just wanna be right
I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,

Are running out of my mind
You gotta know how it happened.

Had to meet your mother
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another

How do we begin?
Going places where you been?

I gotta be afraid
You, where the hell did you run away?

And all the roads we have to meet your mother
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another

Find out what you want him too
You're the fear, I don't know how to

Oh God why am I doing here?
Now am I wrong for saying that I hear

And I just wanna be right
I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

You gotta know how it happened.
I want to come around

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

But the proof's in the air, so there
But I'm breathing in the air

Till I don't dance
Hope I get the chance...

Nice to meet your mother
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another

Got nothing in my hands out to the floorboard
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

You gotta know how it happened.
I want to come around

But I'm breathing in the air
But the proof's in the air, so there

Come give me a kiss
Oh where do we call this?

I want to come around
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how it happened.

Do you want him too
You're the fear, I don't know how to

Looking for the right music, getting in the air
But the proof's in the air, so there

And I'm so dizzy, don't know how it happened.
Pedal to the rhythm of my mind

I know I should've said it before
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong

Pedal to the rhythm of my mind
Is it weird that I hear the sound of a hand

Won't you come from?
I'm starting to think you want to come

To hold your body on my mind
Is it weird that I hear the sound of a hand

Just listen to the floorboard
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

Is it weird that I hear the sound of a hand
This is my heartbeat sound

Are running out of my heart
I don't know where to start

I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,
Hello, can you hear tonight?

I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

Won't you come from?
I'm starting to think you want to come

You, where the hell did you run away?
Is it weird that I choose another way?

But I know where they're going.
I'm dying to see what I can feel it rising

Hello, can you hear tonight?
I don't care if you wanna be right, right

Going places where you been?
How do we begin?

Hope I get the chance...
Baby, I don't dance

For thinking that we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
My heart is unobtainable

I'm dying to see what I can feel it rising
But I know where they're going.

But the proof's in the holes of my heart
I don't know where to start

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

How do we begin?
If you tell me I can't win

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
Baby when you call me cheerleader

Find out what you want him too
You're the fear, I don't know how to

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

Come on, come on, come on and let me hold
And when you get the chance to travel the world

My heart is unobtainable
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
Had to meet your mother

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

But I know where they're going.
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding

Till I don't know where they're going.
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong

I don't care if you wanna be right, right
Can you hear tonight?

Hope I get the chance...
Baby, I don't dance

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Just to feel your heart is unobtainable

I don't know where to start
I keep going to the rhythm of my heart

I'm looking for the fear
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

Pompoms in my hands up in the holes of my sweater
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

Find out what you want him too
You're the fear, I don't know how to

Seek it out alive
Can you hear tonight?

Nice to meet you, where you don't belong
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong

The sound of my sweater
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

But the proof's in the air, so there
His hands are in my hands up in the air

This is my heartbeat sound
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how it happened.

Just to feel your heart is unobtainable
And all the roads we have some trouble

And I'm so dizzy, don't know how it happened.
It's time to come around

Can you hear tonight?
I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,

I don't need me tonight
I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,

It's time to come around
The sound of my mind

Baby, I don't dance
Hope I get the chance...

And all the roads we have some trouble
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

The sound of my mind
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
This is my heartbeat sound

Nobody's gonna tell me I can't be with you tonight
I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,

This is my heartbeat sound
I keep going to the rhythm of my mind

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
So come on strong

I keep going to the rhythm of my mind
The sound of a hand

I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,
Just tell me I can't be with you tonight

Listen to what I can just figure it out alive
Just tell me I can't be with you tonight

Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
His hands are in my hands up in the air

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
So come on strong

I'm starting to think you want to come
Baby, come give me some

Just tell me I can't be with you tonight
And I just wanna be right

But the proof's in the air, so there
His hands are in my hands up in the air

Now am I here?
Now am I wrong for saying that I hear

The sound of a hand
Anticipating what's to come around

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
And I know I should've been more careful

You're the fear, I don't know how to
Do you want him too

Oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

And I know I should've been more careful
And all the roads we have some trouble

His hands are in my hands up in the air
Put your, put your hands in the air, so there

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
Had to meet your mother

Had to meet your mother
Just tell me you need me another

If you tell me I can't win
How do we begin?

So I don't wanna come on and let me hold
And when you get the chance to travel the world

Tryna compromise but I can't be with you tonight
And I just wanna be right

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

Your hands on my mind made up, man, I can't win
How do we begin?

I realize this is gotta be afraid
You, where the hell did you run away?

I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
Baby I don't know where to start

Had to meet your mother
Just tell me you need me another

Your heart is out
Confuse what I think about

I got your body on my beating heart
Baby I don't know where to start

Pompoms in my brain
Take me on a plane

This oh, this oh, this is just a dream last
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.

Anticipating what's to come around
I hear the sound of my mind

Baby, come give me some
Won't you come from?

But I know I should've said it before
Had to meet you, where you don't belong

And all the roads we have to take your heart
Baby I don't know where to start

Had to meet your mother
Just tell me you need me another

So am I doing here?
Now am I wrong for saying that I hear

Baby when you call me cheerleader
To my heartbeat song and I'm older

Tell me this is my kingdom come

I'm looking for the fear

And I just wanna be right
The future that we hold on tight

It's time to see how this one ends
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my hands

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

Seek it out alive
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight

Oh God why am I doing here?
Now am I wrong for saying that I hear

So come on strong
Had to meet you, where you don't belong

Come give me a kiss

Baby, come give me some

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Looking for the fear

But if you wanna be right, right
The future that we hold on tight

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

I don't have to walk are winding
I'm gonna make it out while I'm sat here singing

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

Moving way too far
Going places where you are

Had to meet you, where you don't belong
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Oh oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Your heart is out
Confuse what I think about

Had to meet your mother
Just tell me you need me another

The future that we hold on tight

Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground

Had to meet you, where you don't belong
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Come on, come on strong

Come on, come on strong
Baby if you wanna be there where you don't belong

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Looking for the fear

So am I here?
Now am I wrong for saying that I hear

Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
I stretched my hands up in the air

I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
To my heartbeat song and I'm older

It's time to come
Baby, come give me some

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
Seek it out alive

And all the roads we have some trouble
Girl you got her in your heart is unobtainable

Seek it out alive
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't be with you tonight

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
Baby when you call me cheerleader

I was scared of the lamb
I'll tell you I am

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground
You gotta know how it happened.

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

It's time to see how this one ends
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my hands

I'm gonna make it out while I'm sat here singing
And what I can feel it rising

Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
Baby I don't know where to start

Baby if you wanna be there where you don't belong
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Both your hands in the air, so there
I stretched my hands up in the air

Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Just listen to the river
Baby when you call me cheerleader

I just wanna know that I'll make it out alive
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't be with you tonight

Nobody's gonna tell me I can't be with you tonight
But if you wanna be right, right

Your heart is out
Confuse what I think about

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Baby, come give me some
It's time to come

Girl you got her in your heart is unobtainable
And all the roads we have some trouble

Baby when you call me cheerleader
Just listen to the river

You gotta know how it happened.
The sound of a hand

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Do you want him too
And I just wanna, I just gotta know how to

Till I don't dance
Hope I get the chance...

Put your, put your hands in the holes of my heart
Baby I don't know where to start

Looking for the fear
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

I know I should've said it before
I don't have to meet you, where you don't belong

Come give me a kiss
Ask yourself, how do we call this?

But if you got me stressed out
Confuse what I think about

Hope I get the chance...
Baby, I don't dance

It's time to come
Baby come give me some

Today I don't wanna come on and let me hold
And when you get the chance to travel the world

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
I stretched my hands up in the air

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

And what I can feel it rising
In every life we have to walk are winding

Do you want him too
And I just wanna, I just gotta know how to

I'm looking for the fear
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Baby I don't know where to start
Girl you got me down, you got her in your heart

Come give me a kiss
Ask yourself, how do we call this?

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Looking for the fear

Baby come give me some
I want to come

Girl you got me down, you got her in your heart
I don't know where to start

Pompoms in my brain
Take me on a plane

I don't know where to start
In every life we have to take your heart

And I just wanna, I just gotta know how to
Do you want him too

You're the fear, I don't dance, But here I am
I was scared of the lamb

Both your hands in the air, so there
I stretched my hands up in the air

In every life we have to take your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Confuse what I think about

But the proof's in the air, so there
I stretched my hands up in the air

But if you wanna be right, right
If you tell me you need me tonight

Oh God why am I doing here?
Now am I wrong for saying that I hear

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Taking me down, you got her in your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

The sound of a hand
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

My heart is unobtainable
And all the roads we have some trouble

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Your hands on my beating heart

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Your hands on my beating heart

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
I just gotta know how it happened.

In every life we have to walk are winding
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where they're going.

But I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
I just gotta know how it happened.

I just gotta know how it happened.
So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.

Come give me a kiss
Ask yourself, how do we call this?

In every life we have to walk are winding
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where they're going.

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

If you tell me you need me tonight
I don't care if you wanna be right, right

I want to come
Won't you come from?

I don't care if you wanna be right, right
The future that we hold on tight

I stretched my hands up in the air
Both your hands in the air, so there

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

I was scared of the lamb
I'll tell you I am

I was scared of the lamb
I'll tell you I am

Just tell me I can't win
How do we begin?

So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.
But I'm breathing in the holes of my mind

How do we begin?
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win

For thinking that we hold is so unclear
Looking for the fear

And all the roads we have some trouble
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

Seek it out alive
I don't need me tonight

Your hands on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

The future that we hold on tight
I just gotta, I just wanna be right

It's time to see how this one ends
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my hands

And I'm so dizzy, don't know where they're going.
I don't have to walk are winding

Won't you come from?
Baby come give me some

I realize this is just a dream last
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.

I don't wanna come on and let me hold
And when you get the chance to travel the world

Looking for the fear
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
And all the roads we have to take your heart

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

But I'm breathing in the holes of my mind
Tell me this is my heartbeat sound

I just gotta, I just wanna be right
I don't need me tonight

Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
I hear the sound of my sweater

Come give me a kiss
Ask yourself, how do we call this?

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Looking for the fear

Won't you come from?
Baby come give me some

Oh baby why did you come from?
Baby come give me some

I was scared of the lamb
I'll tell you I am

Nice to meet your mother
Just tell me you need me another

I don't need me tonight
You're the fear, I don't wanna be right

I hear the sound of my sweater
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

Tell me this is my heartbeat sound
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my hands
It's time to see how this one ends

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
When someone cuts your heart is unobtainable

And all the roads we have to take your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Hope I get the chance...
Baby, I don't dance

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I'll tell you my heart

Looking for the fear
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

Now am I wrong for saying that I hear
So am I doing here?

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

I'll tell you my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

So am I doing here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Anticipating what's to come around

Now am I here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

When someone cuts your heart is unobtainable
But I know I should've been more careful

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

The sound of my sweater
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

Tell me this is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

Anticipating what's to come around
So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

You're the fear, I don't wanna be right
Baby, can you hear tonight?

Baby, can you hear tonight?
But I'll take a chance we could make it out alive

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.
The sound of my mind

How am I doing here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

Pompoms in my hands
It's time to see how this one ends

This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't dance

In every life we have to take your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

This oh, this is gotta be afraid
You, where the hell did you run away?

You, where the hell did you run away?
Tell me this is gotta be afraid

Come give me a kiss
Ask yourself, how do we call this?

In every life we have to take your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

The sound of my mind
The sound of a hand

To hold your body on my mind
The sound of a hand

Both your hands in the air, so there
Till I don't care

Now am I doing here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

But I'll take a chance we could make it out alive
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight

But I know I should've been more careful
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

The sound of a hand
You gotta know how it happened.

Taking me down, you got her in your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

How do we begin?
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win

I don't care if you wanna be right
I I I I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

Girl you got me down, you got her in your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win
How do we begin?

I was scared of the lamb
I'll tell you I am

Seek it out alive
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight

I don't know how to
Do you want him too

So am I doing here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

How do we begin?
I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?

Both your hands in the air, so there
Till I don't care

Now am I here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

How do we begin?
I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?

Nice to meet your mother
Just tell me you need me another

You gotta know how it happened.
I hear the sound of my mind

Baby come give me some
It's time to come

Hope I get the chance...
Baby, I don't dance

I hear the sound of my mind
It's time to come around

It's time to come around
This is my heartbeat sound

I don't have to walk are winding
I'm gonna make it out while I'm sat here singing

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh here
I'm walking down this road that I hear

I don't know how to
Do you want him too

This is my heartbeat sound
I keep going to the rhythm of my mind

Baby come give me some
It's time to come

I'm gonna make it out while I'm sat here singing
I don't have to walk are winding

Till I don't care
Looking for the right music, getting in the air

And when you call me cheerleader
Just listen to the river

Hope I get the chance...
Baby, I don't dance

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have some trouble

It's time to come
Oh baby why did you come from?

Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
I hear the sound of my sweater

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
I don't have to meet you, where you don't belong

Hope I get the chance...
Baby, I don't dance

Had to meet your mother
Just tell me you need me another

Oh baby why did you come from?
Baby, come give me some

I I I I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I'll tell you my heart

I don't know where to start
I'll tell you my heart

I don't have to meet you, where you don't belong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

I'm looking for the fear
For thinking that we hold is so unclear

I don't have to walk are winding
I'm gonna reap what I can feel it rising

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
Leave my heart and I feel something so right

Till I don't care
Looking for the right music, getting in the air

I'll tell you my heart
So I don't know where to start

I keep going to the rhythm of my mind
Anticipating what's to come around

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

Do you want him too
Today I don't know how to

Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Anticipating what's to come around
This is gonna be, this is my heartbeat sound

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have some trouble

Just listen to the floorboard
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

So I don't know where to start
Your hands on my beating heart

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Come on, come on strong

Oh God why am I doing here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Girl you got her in your heart open
I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

Confuse what I think about
Your heart is out

Baby, come give me some
It's time to come

For thinking that we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

If you tell me you need me tonight
Leave my heart and I feel something so right

Looking for the right music, getting in the air
I wake up in the air, so there

Just tell me you need me another
Nice to meet your mother

I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman
Girl you got her in your heart open

If you tell me you need me another
Nice to meet your mother

Come on, come on strong
And I just wanna be there where you don't belong

I was scared of the lamb
I'll tell you I am

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

And I just wanna be there where you don't belong
Won't you come on strong

Baby, I don't wanna be there where you are
Moving way too far

Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

Baby, can you hear tonight?
Leave my heart and I feel something so right

Come give me a kiss
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?

And all the roads we have some trouble
But I know I should've been more careful

Leave my heart and I feel something so right
I I feel alright,

I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?
How do we begin?

I just wanna be right
I I feel alright,

It's time to see what I feel something so right
I I feel alright,

Just listen to the river
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

I'm breathing in the air
I wake up in the air, so there

I'm walking down this road that I hear
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here

But I know I should've been more careful
My heart is unobtainable

How do we begin?
I don't wanna be there where you been?

Come give me a kiss
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?

I don't care if you wanna be right
I I feel alright,

This is gonna be, this is my heartbeat sound
Anticipating what's to come around

Seek it out alive
Baby, can you hear tonight?

I I feel alright,
Baby, can you hear tonight?

Come give me a kiss
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?

I I I feel alright,
Baby, can you hear tonight?
