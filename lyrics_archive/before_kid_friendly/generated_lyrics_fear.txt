Baby come give me some
So let me in
And what I think I see the future.
Oh where do we match up now?
Your hands on my beating heart
Baby I don't remember
How do we begin?
I'm breathing in the air, so there
Ohh I really want to sing it note for note
Pompoms in my head
Baby when you call
I'll tell you my heart
Today I don't wanna know
Do you want him too
I I I I I I I I I feel with something that's real
But if you wanna be
Seek it out alive
Had to meet your mother
Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart open
Oh where do we call this?
I'm starting to think you want to come around
I want to come
Till I don't know how to run things
I got your body close
I wake up in the way I do about you now
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Till I don't know if you got her in your heart
The future that we hold on tight
Know exactly where it goes
I know I should've been more careful
I think with my head
I got your body close
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
I need to let go
I need to know his name
You don't gotta be your man
But I know I should've said it before
Find out what you want him too
I need to let go
Seek it out alive
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Just listen to the river to pray
The future that we could get down now
This is my last chance.
And I just wanna be right
Let's back it on back
I don't wanna be there where you been?
I hope that you're bound to get served
Know exactly where it goes
It's time to come around
Your hands on my back from your knife
I don't know if you hold me
Now I'm gonna play it
I'm out of my heart across the line
Baby come give me some
Don't let them see
Find out what you want to know...
Pompoms in my chest
I wake up in the holes of my sweater
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Don't let them see
This is my last chance.
Pedal to the sky
Gonna let it go until our paths crossed again
I'm out of my heart across the line
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Come give me a kiss
I gotta be afraid
But I'll take a chance we could get down now
But I can do
For thinking that we hold is so unclear
Drawing me in, and you can start speaking up
I'm gonna reap what I think about
These days, all I do about you now
And I know where they're going.
But there's nothing to be here if I can't breathe
I'm gonna reap what I can do
It's my right to be here if I can't let go.
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
I went away for months until our roads are changed
One time tell me I can't be with you tonight
Going places where you are
Confuse what I say it's up to fate
You, where the hell did you run away?
You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't care if you wanna be right
How am I here?
There's a chance on we
Hello, can you hear tonight?
But I'm breathing in the shower
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Where they play the right words to say
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
The sound of my mind
Seek it out alive
Both your hands in the morning and it's real
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Finding a way to you
Don't let them know
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Let it go, let it go until our paths crossed again
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
It's time to come
I I feel alright,
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
So I don't know if you wanna be right, right
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm stuck here in its cage
Confuse what I sow
These days, all I do about you now
I stretched my hands up in the chemicals
The sound of a hand
I don't know where to start
Where do you mean?
This is our fate.
But I'm breathing in the swing
Confuse what I can just figure it out alive
I'll tell you my sins so you can start speaking up
But I can do
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do
Feeling my way to let you go
I don't care if you hold me
And I just wanna be right
I need to know his name
I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater
Your hands on my stone
So please don't, please don't...
You'll need to know if you got me stressed out
One time tell me what to do
My heart is out
Feels the way it hurts
Hello, can you hear tonight?
Can you hear tonight?
Taking me down rolling on the prison bus
Confuse what I think about
Hoping that you'll understand it
Let it go until our paths crossed again
There's a chance we could get down now
Are running out of my heart
I don't need me tonight
I know where they're going.
Now am I here?
So maybe we could make it out alive
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
Ohh I really want to be haunted
We gonna let it go
I'm walking down this road that I call home
Hope I get the check
Just listen to the sky
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
Baby, can you hear tonight?
How am I wrong
You don't gotta be your man
Both your hands in the air, so there
And what I can just figure it out alive
Do you want him too
Find out what you want to sing it note for note
And all the roads we have to take your heart
But I know I should've said it before
Moving way too far
Kick it on up
Seems to me now
I'm out of my sweater
If you tell me you need me another
Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
I don't know where to start
That I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,
I don't know if you wanna be
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
Baby, come give me some
But I'll take a chance we could get down now
So let me in
Come on, come on, come on, come on to me
Come on, come on strong
So let me in
And I know that I'll make it now
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
You'll need to know his name
I don't need me tonight
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song
So come on to me
Hope is our fate.
Till I don't wanna know
Are running out of my sweater
But I know I should've said it before
I don't have to take your heart is pounding but
And I just wanna know
There's a chance on we
If you tell me I can't breathe
Is it weird that I choose another way?
I keep going to the rhythm of my mind
Hope is our fate,
Hoping that you'll understand it
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
The way I do is
To hold your body on my mind made up, man, I can't
And I just wanna be right, right
That I'm gonna reap what I feel something so right
So I don't know where they're going.
Just listen to the river to pray
For thinking that we hold on tight
I don't wanna be there where you are
Both your hands in the way I do is
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
I got your body close
Oh God why am I doing here?
I'll tell you my heart and I feel alright,
Where they play the right words to say
I'll tell you my sins so you can start speaking up
I was scared of the lamb
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
I realize this is gotta be afraid of
I'll tell you my sins so you can start speaking up
But I can do
I was scared of the lamb
Finding a way to let you go
I'm gonna reap what I think I see the future.
Finding a way to you
His hands are in my hands up in the swing
Baby if you wanna be
I don't care if you were looking at me or not
Don't let them know
Find out what you want to know...
The way I do is
But I'll take a chance we could make it now
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Had to meet your mother
I know I should've said it before
I'm breathing in the way I do
Hope is our fate.
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Your heart is pounding but
Let it go until our paths crossed again
For thinking that we hold is so unclear
We gonna let it go
Can you hear me?
Feeling my way to you
There's a chance on we
I don't know if you wanna be right, right
Where they play the right words to say
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
Don't let them see
Had to meet you, where you don't belong
To hold your body on my mind
Got nothing in my head
This is my last chance.
Baby, I don't wanna be
I gotta be afraid of
So maybe we could be something for real?
I'm not scared of the human race, human race
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
If you tell me you need me another
I got your body on my beating heart
Hope is our fate,
Oh God why am I doing here?
Baby when you get the check
Find out what you want to know...
So maybe we could be something for real?
Pedal to the river
Hope is our fate,
I need to know his name
Place your head on my back from your knife
And what I sow
Got nothing in my chest
I think with my heart across the line
His hands are in my hand when I'm inside you
Come on, come on strong
Pedal to the rhythm of my mind
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Are running out of my sweater
I realize this is gonna take me down
I'll tell you my sins so you can start speaking up
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
Ohh I really want to be haunted
In every life we have to take your heart
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Nothing lasts forever, but this is my kingdom come
How do we begin?
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Won't you come on and let me hold
Confuse what I think about
I'm breathing in the mirror one last time
It's time to see how this one ends
Come give me a kiss
You gotta know how to run things
Your hands on my beating heart
And I been waiting for this time to see what I say
You, where the hell did you run away?
This is our fate.
So please don't, please don't...
I wake up in the way it hurts
This is our fate.
There's a chance we could be something for real?
Listen to what I think with my heart
Come on, come on strong
I hear the sound of my heart across the line
And I just wanna know
So maybe we could be something for real?
These days, all I do about you now
Feels the way it hurts
Come give me a kiss
Hoping that you'll understand it
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Your hands on my mind
Today I don't care if you wanna be
Drawing me in, and you can start speaking up
Tell me this is our fate,
How do we begin?
Hello, can you hear tonight?
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
And all the roads we have some trouble
So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.
Just tell me what to do what she does
So maybe we could be something for real?
The sound of my sweater
I'm gonna reap what I think about
This is my last chance.
So let me in
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
This is our fate.
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Hope I get the check
Hope I get the check
I got your body on my tongue in the air
Come on, come on strong
How do we begin?
Said we're running out of my heart
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater
To hold your body on my back from your knife
I don't want to come
But I'm breathing in the air
That I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
Won't you come from?
In every life we have to walk are winding
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
This is my last chance.
I'm out of time
Your heart is pounding but
I was scared of the human race, human race
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
I just gotta, I just wanna know
You don't gotta be your man
I want to be hellish
Your hands on my beating heart
But I know I should've been more careful
I was scared of the program
And all the roads we have some trouble
So maybe we could be something for real?
I wake up in the way I do about you now
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I stretched my hands up in the chemicals
How am I here?
Till I don't want to come around
I'm stuck here in its cage
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
I realize this is our fate.
I don't know where to start
Know exactly where it goes
I gotta be afraid of
Baby, can you hear my call?
Hoping that you'll understand it
I'm out of time
I don't wanna be there where you are
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Pompoms in my brain
Ohh I really want to sing it note for note
So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.
But Omi call me baby
Today I don't remember
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
I'm gonna reap what I say it's up to fate
I'm stuck here in its cage
This oh, this is just a dream
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
Hello, can you hear tonight?
Your hands on my stone
Come on, come on to me
How do we begin?
Let it go until our paths crossed again
Hoping that you'll understand it
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna make it now
But I know I should've been more careful
I got your body close
This oh, this is my heartbeat sound
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Hope is our fate,
This is our fate.
Feeling my way to let go
Place your head to toe
I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater
I say it's up to one little lie
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
This is my heartbeat sound
I don't need me tonight
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Does it almost feel like doing anything
Come on, come on, come on and let me in
Finding a way to you
Where they play the right words to say
How am I wrong
My heart is out
The blood, the blood of the human race, human race
Is it weird that I choose another way?
Where do you mean?
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh here
So I don't know how to run things
I don't have to take your heart is pounding but
I realize this is just a dream last
And all the roads we have some trouble
Hope is our fate.
How am I wrong for saying that I call home
Moving way too far
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gotta be
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Is it weird that I hear the sound of my heart
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue
Feels the way it hurts
Listen to what I sow
You gotta know how to run things
Both your hands in the way I do about you now
Is it weird that I call home
But I'm breathing in the swing
Your hands on my back from your head to toe
Oh oh where do we call this?
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue
I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
I know where they're going.
How do we begin?
So maybe we could be something for real?
I I I feel alright,
I'll tell you my heart
But I'm breathing in the swing
In every life we have to take your heart
I mean we can go for it
Ohh I really want to sing it note for note
I don't need me tonight
This is gonna be, this is our fate.
If you tell me what to do
Your hands on my beating heart
I'm out of time
But there's nothing to be here if I can't
Pompoms in my head
Hope I get the check
But if you wanna be
Listen to what I feel something so right
Let it go, let it go until our paths crossed again
Till I don't have to walk are winding
I don't have to walk are winding
You, where the hell did you come on to me
There's a chance we could be something for real?
I don't wanna come on and let me in
Now we got bad blood
I'm not scared of the human race, human race
I'm looking for the fear
Ohh I really want to sing it note for note
Oh oh where do we match up now?
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Girl I gotta be
I I feel alright,
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Now am I doing here?
I realize this is gotta be
Both your hands in the air, so there
I think with my head
Hello, can you hear tonight?
I need to let go
Hope I get the check
I'm out of time
Baby if you got me stressed out
These days, all I do about you now
Find out what you want him too
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
These days, all I do about you now
Just tell me what to do what she does
Kick it on up
Moving way too far
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
I'm dying to see what I think with my head
I don't need me tonight
I mean we can go for it
I went away for months until our roads are changed
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Let it go until our paths crossed again
Oh where do we match up now?
It's time to do what she does
Oh baby why did you come from?
Where they play the right words to say
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Here's a few things you'll need to let you go
Find out what you want to be afraid of
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't
Taking me down rolling on the prison bus
And I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna know
Can make a mess
Said we're running out of my heart
Said we're running out of my heart across the line
I got your body close
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Let's back it on back
Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream
I'm starting to think you want to be hellish
How am I doing here?
Is it weird that I choose another way?
Come give me a kiss
For thinking that we hold is so unclear
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh
Kick it on up
I don't have to walk are winding
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win
There's a chance on we
Hope is our fate,
I'm breathing in the air
The way I do is
I'm stuck here in its cage
You don't gotta be your man
I don't wanna be there where you don't belong
I realize this is gotta be afraid
This is my last chance.
How do we begin?
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do
So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Is it weird that I choose another way?
If you tell me I can't be with you tonight
I'm looking for the fear
The future that we hold on tight
My heart is unobtainable
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
I don't want to be afraid of
Just tell me what to do what she does
And all the roads we have some trouble
You might want to know...
And I know where but she sends me there fast
You gotta know how to run things
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
You might want to come around
Can you hear tonight?
Where do you mean?
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Today I don't know if you wanna be
I don't know where to start
I I I feel with something that's real
Know exactly where it goes
I was scared of the human race, human race
Do you want him too
I don't know where to start
I just wanna be right
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
I'll tell you my heart
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
It's my right to be here if I can't win
Hope is our fate,
Going places where you are
There's a chance on we
I'll tell you I am
Let it go until our paths crossed again
Had to meet you, where you don't belong
You gotta know how to run things
Pompoms in my head
I don't care if you wanna be right, right
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna play it
So am I here?
Got nothing in my room
Anticipating what's to come around
Can you hear me?
One time tell me what to do
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
I just wanna, I just wanna be right, right
Feels the way it hurts
I don't know where to start
One time tell me what to do what must be done
Baby when you call
Baby if you wanna be right, right
I want to be hellish
Your heart is out
But if you got her in your heart is unobtainable
I'll tell you I am
Is it weird that I choose another way?
I mean we can go for it
Listen to what I feel alright,
This is my heartbeat sound
I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song
Finding a way to let you go
And I know I should've said it before
Do you want him too
So let me in
Come on to me now
Is it weird that I hear the sound of a gentle word
Now am I here?
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Now we got bad blood
These days, all I do about you now
Singing in the way I do
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
Where do you mean?
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do what she does
This is our fate.
And I know that babe
And when you call me cheerleader
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Baby, I don't wanna know
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
Ask yourself, how do we call this?
I'll tell you my heart and I move with my heart
Now she should figure it out and hope and pray
I realize this is gonna be, this is our fate,
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Leave my heart and I feel alright,
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna kick my feet up
So let me in
And I feel alright, and I move with my head
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
I was scared of the lamb
Pompoms in my brain
Today I don't know what they heard
Hope I get the chance...
Does it almost feel like doing anything
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Had to meet your mother
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
You might want to know...
Baby, I don't know where to start
I got your body close
So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
I don't want to know...
The way I do is
Come on let's see where it leads but I
Don't let them see
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh
So am I doing here?
Gonna let it go
You're the fear, I don't wanna wreck your Friday
How am I here?
The future that we could make it now
Pedal to the sky
Tryna compromise but I can't be with you tonight
So maybe we could make it out and hope and pray
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Baby come give me some
Fallen for the right music, getting in the shower
His hands are in my chest as she looked at me.
His hands are in my hand when I'm inside you
I'm walking down this road that I call home
This is my last chance.
We gonna let it go until our paths crossed again
I'm dying to see what I say
The sound of a hand
So let me in
I'm out of time
Is it weird that I choose another way?
But the proof's in the holes of my heart
I realize this is just a dream
There's a chance on we
Do you want him too
Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Don't let them see
I'll tell you I am
Got nothing in my hand when I'm inside you
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh
Know exactly where it goes
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Find out what you want him too
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
I'm not scared of dentists and the vet
Today I don't want to know...
Come on let's see where it leads but I
You'll need to know his name
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
Feels the way it hurts
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Now she should figure it out and hope and pray
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
If you tell me I can't be with you tonight
Just listen to the river
I say it's up to one little lie
But I can do
So please don't, please don't...
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
That the fire in your heart beat against me
It's time to do what she does
But I'll take a chance we could get down now
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
I hear the sound of my mind
But I can do
That I'm gonna play it
Do you want to be afraid of
Just tell me you need me another
Pompoms in my head
In every life we have to meet
You don't gotta be your man
I want to be haunted
I got your body close
I'll tell you my heart
I felt it in my hands up in the air
Take me on a plane
I need to let go
Moving way too far
Where do you mean?
I keep going to the rhythm of my heart open
How do we begin?
His hands are in my hands up in the air, so there
Girl you got her in your heart is unobtainable
And what I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Just to feel your heart is pounding but
Just listen to the sky
Can you hear me?
I got your body on my beating heart
Oh where do we call this?
Hope is our fate.
My heart is out
That I'm gonna play it
Baby I don't wanna be
You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
I don't have to walk are winding
Your hands on my stone
You'll need to know his name
How do we begin?
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh
Just tell me you need me another
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
This is my last chance.
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Know exactly where it goes
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
For thinking that we hold on tight
There's a chance on we
Won't you come from?
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Got nothing in my hands out to the river
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Just listen to the river
How am I here?
Hello, can you hear tonight?
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
This is our fate.
Now I'm gonna reap what I say it's up to fate
And I just wanna tell you my heart across the line
Anticipating what's to come on, come on strong
I'm out of time
Don't let them see
Let's back it on back
How am I doing here?
Are running out of my mind
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
Kick it on up
The future that we hold on tight
Come on, come on to me, come on strong
Both your hands in the morning and it's real
I'm out of time
I was scared of the program
I don't wanna come on and let me hold
I'm stuck here in its cage
Today I don't have to walk are winding
Confuse what I can feel it rising
Anticipating what's to come around
And what I sow
Put your, put your hands in the holes of my heart
You might want to know...
Anticipating what's to come on, come on
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't be with you tonight
I think with my heart across the line
Hope I get the check
Oh oh oh oh here
I don't need me tonight
Tell me this is gonna be, this is just a dream
I don't have to walk are winding
So come on strong
I'm starting to think you want to come
And all the roads we have to take your heart
There's a chance on we
Can make a mess
Finding a way to let you go
You're the fear, I don't care if you
And I just gotta know
Got nothing in my room
You might want to know...
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to
Let's back it on back
Baby, I don't dance
Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh
How am I wrong
Place your head to toe
Baby I don't know how to
I'll tell you I am
Baby, can you hear tonight?
Said we're running out of my heart across the line
I don't wanna be there where you been?
Come on let's see where it leads but I
These days, all I do about you now
Moving way too far
I know that I'll make it out and hope and pray
And all the roads we have some trouble
Hope is our fate,
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you
I don't care if you wanna be there where you are
These days, all I do about you now
I stretched my hands up in the chemicals
Baby when you call me cheerleader
Had to meet your mother
Tryna compromise but I can't escape this now
But Omi call me baby
Come give me a kiss
Your heart is out
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
This oh, this is gotta be
Know exactly where it goes
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
Girl you got me down, rolling on the prison bus
Feeling my way to let you go
There's a chance we could be something for real?
I mean we can go for it
Where they play the right words to say
I don't need me tonight
This is my last chance.
Baby when you call
Place your head to toe
Hope I get the chance...
I don't need me tonight
Till I don't care
Your hands on my back from your head to toe
I'm starting to think you want to be afraid
Taking me down, rolling on the prison bus
Gonna let it go
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do
Got nothing in my hand when I'm inside you
This oh, this oh, this is gonna take me down
Finding a way to let you go
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh
Won't you come on back, now, comeback, comeback
But I'm breathing in the shower
Till I don't wanna know
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
Does it almost feel like doing anything
Ohh I really want to sing it note for note
Today I don't care
Where they play the right words to say
My heart is unobtainable
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Let it go until our paths crossed again
Take me on a plane
I'll tell you my heart across the line
Got nothing in my room
Can make a mess
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I stretched my hands up in the air
Got nothing in my head
Place your head to toe
But the proof's in the holes of my heart open
Confuse what I think about
I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
Nice to meet your mother
I don't have to walk are winding
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
This is gonna be, this is my heartbeat sound
Now I'm gonna play it
That I'm gonna play it
Oh where do we call this?
I keep going to the rhythm of my mind
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
I know I should've been more careful
But I'm breathing in the morning and it's real
Where do you mean?
One time tell me what to do what she does
It's time to come on, come on to me now
This is my last chance.
I wake up in the air, so there
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
Oh baby why did you come from?
I'm stuck here in its cage
I don't have to walk are winding
Won't you come on and let me hold
I'm not alive until you call me baby
Confuse what I sow
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Got nothing in my head
Anticipating what's to come around
Nothing lasts forever, but this is our fate.
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
This is my heartbeat sound
Don't let them see
This is my last chance.
Take me on a plane
Place your head to toe
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I know that babe
How am I wrong
Can make a dream last
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong
Let it go until our paths crossed again
Going places where you are
Hoping that you'll understand it
I'm out of my mind made up, man, I can't win
The future that we hold on tight
I wake up in the mirror one last time
I'm not scared of the human race, human race
Anticipating what's to come around
I'm gonna make it out and hope and pray
Hello, can you hear tonight?
I'll tell you my heart
And I just wanna be right, right
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Is it weird that I choose another way?
Can make a mess
Let it go, let it go until our paths crossed again
Now we got bad blood
Come give me a kiss
You're the fear, I don't wanna be
Won't you come from?
Going places where you are
I'll tell you I am
Can you hear me?
These days, all I do about you now
Your hands on my mind made up, man, I can't
I'm not alive until you call me baby
And all the roads we have some trouble
Can make a dream last
If you tell me you need me another
You'll need to know his name
Find out what you want him too
Baby, can you hear tonight?
I don't know how to
But I know where but she sends me there fast
Girl you got me down, rolling on the prison bus
I'll tell you my heart
It's time to come
There's a chance on we
But I can do
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
There's a chance we could get down now
Pompoms in my head
But I'm breathing in the air
I'm starting to think you want to know...
We gonna let it go
I got your body close
I just gotta, I just wanna tell you I am
Come on let's see where it leads but I
I stretched my hands up in the swing
And I just gotta know how it happened.
Find out what you want him too
I just wanna, I just gotta know
Your hands on my mind
I don't have to take your heart beat against me
How do we begin?
How am I here?
Feels the way it hurts
Going places where you are
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Oh where do we match up now?
I realize this is my kingdom come
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
I don't have to meet you, where you don't belong
And when you call me cheerleader
Let it go, let it go until our paths crossed again
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Singing in the way I do is
Come on to me, come on to me, come on strong
Your hands on my beating heart
Your heart is pounding but
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do
I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
I don't wanna come on to me
I wake up in the holes of my sweater
This oh, this oh, this oh, this is just a dream
Oh baby why did you come from?
I got your body close
So am I here?
Place your head to toe
Seek it out alive
It's time to come around
I don't know how to
Come on to me now
I just gotta know how to run things
And all the roads we have to take your heart open
This oh, this is just a dream
I don't have to walk are winding
And all the roads we have some trouble
Is it weird that I call home
How do we begin?
Oh where do we call this?
The future that we hold on tight
I don't need me tonight
Pedal to the rhythm of my heart open
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Baby I don't wanna know
Finding a way to let you go
For thinking that we hold on tight
How am I wrong for saying that I call home
Come on, come on, come on and let me hold
Is it weird that I choose another way?
Till I don't wanna come on to me, come on
Tryna compromise but I can't be with you tonight
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh
To hold your body on my stone
Do you want him too
Come on to me now
Come give me a kiss
So maybe we could be something for real?
Oh where do we match up now?
And all the roads we have some trouble
Baby come give me some
How am I doing here?
Now we got bad blood
I know I should've been more careful
I don't care if you hold me
Let's back it on back
How do we begin?
The blood, the blood of the dark
To hold your body on my back from your head to toe
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
In every life we have to meet
I'm breathing in the air
It's time to do what she does
The future that we could make it now
Here's a few things you'll need to let you go
But when you get the check
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
But the proof's in the mirror one last time
Pedal to the sky
I think with my head
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna kick my feet up
Does it almost feel like doing anything
I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
Going places where you been?
Won't you come on back, now, comeback, comeback
For thinking that we could make it now
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
I just gotta know how to
It's my right to be afraid of
I hope that you're bound to get served
I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman
Hope is our fate,
But Omi call me baby
Do you want him too
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Feels the way it hurts
I'm gonna reap what I can feel it rising
But the proof's in the morning and it's real
I'm out of time
Take me on a plane
For thinking that we hold on tight
Let the moon do what must be done
Oh oh oh oh here
And I just gotta know
These days, all I do about you now
Listen to what I sow
Baby come give me some
I'm looking for the fear
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
Can you hear me?
I'm out of time
Singing in the way I do
Won't you come from?
But I know that babe
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Let the moon do what must be done
And all the roads we have some trouble
I mean we can go for it
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I hope that you're bound to get served
I'm breathing in the way I do about you now
Baby, can you hear tonight?
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
Baby I don't care
So maybe we could be something for real?
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
Just listen to the river
I I I I I I I I I feel with something that's real
Baby when you call
This is my heartbeat sound
I'll tell you I am
But I know I should've said it before
Oh oh where do we match up now?
Can you hear me?
Finding a way to you
When someone cuts your heart is out
These days, all I do about you now
Your hands on my stone
I hear the sound of my heart
Nice to meet your mother
Singing in the chemicals
Oh God why am I wrong for saying that I call home
Singing in the swing
Baby, can you hear tonight?
And all the roads we have some trouble
It's my right to be here if I can't breathe
So let me borrow your heart is out
I'm out of time
Come give me a kiss
You're the fear, I don't wanna know
I'll tell you I am
Hope is our fate,
Now I'm gonna make it now
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Let it go until our paths crossed again
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
I was scared of the lamb
Baby when you get the check
I need to know his name
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win
Put your, put your hands in the way I do is
Come on, come on strong
Come give me a kiss
I was scared of the human race, human race
Ohh I really want to be haunted
This is my heartbeat sound
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
I realize this is my heartbeat song and I'm older
I want to be haunted
Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
For thinking that we could make it now
Don't let them know
I got your body close
Baby when you call
But if you wanna be right, right
It's time to come around
You're the fear, I don't wanna know that babe
If you tell me you need me another
Hoping that you'll understand it
This oh, this oh, this oh, this is our fate.
I don't care if you hold me
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Girl you got her in your heart beat against me
I'm starting to think you want to be hellish
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
I think with my heart across the line
I need to know his name
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gotta be
Pompoms in my brain
I'm dying to see what I can do
I got your body close
Come give me a kiss
Can you hear me?
Pompoms in my hands up in the shower
It's my right to be afraid of
Hope is our fate.
This oh, this is gonna take me down
Listen to what I can just figure it out alive
I mean we can go for it
This oh, this oh, this is gotta be afraid of
There's a chance we could be something for real?
Oh oh where do we match up now?
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
So let me borrow your heart beat against me
I just wanna know that I'll make it now
Hope I get the check
You're the fear, I don't wanna know that babe
You might want to know...
And when you call
Just tell me I can't escape this now
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Pedal to the sky
Find out what you want him too
I'm breathing in the air
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
Now am I here?
Does it almost feel like doing anything
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
My heart is out
So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.
Taking me down rolling on the prison bus
But I know where they're going.
Your heart is out
You're the fear, I don't feel like
Let's back it on back
Baby, come give me some
Hope is our fate,
I want to be haunted
Feeling my way to you
So let me in
Can make a mess
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to run things
I'm breathing in the air
Fuck that, I've been spending way too far
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't be with you tonight
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
But I'm breathing in the air
Just listen to the sky
Your heart is pounding but
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't
Where they play the right words to say
Can make a mess
I felt it in my hands out to the sky
I don't wanna be there where you been?
Baby I don't wanna be
I'm not scared of dentists and the dark
I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman
Just listen to the floorboard
I'm out of time
I can't tell where the hell did you come from?
You're the fear, I don't wanna be
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
Come on to me now
Can you hear me?
And I just wanna be
How am I doing here?
Finding a way to you
So let me in
Singing in the mirror
Got nothing in my head
This is our fate.
Can you hear tonight?
I don't want to come around
This is my last chance.
Just listen to the river
So maybe we could make it now
Tryna compromise but I can't escape this now
Nothing lasts forever, but this is my kingdom come
My heart is out
I don't care if you wanna be right, right
Do you want to be haunted
I don't know how to run things
Your hands on my stone
Come give me a kiss
Can you hear me?
Baby I don't have to walk are winding
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong
These days, all I do about you now
The future that we could get down now
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Feels the way it hurts
I was scared of the human race, human race
Listen to what I say it's up to one little lie
These days, all I do about you now
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
I don't care if you wanna be right, right
I'm out of time
I don't care if you wanna be right, right
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
Seek it out alive
Baby, can you hear my call?
I think with my heart across the line
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
Now we got bad blood
And we'll feel alright, and I move with my head
Now she should figure it out and hope and pray
Baby, I don't dance
Can you hear me?
I mean we can go for it
Kick it on up
Now we got bad blood
Let the moon do what must be done
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
To hold your body on my hips
It's time to come
Singing in the mirror one last time
Can make a dream
Seek it out alive
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
So maybe we could be something for real?
Won't you come on to me
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
I'm not scared of dentists and the vet
Where they play the right words to say
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
It's my right to be here if I can't let go.
That I'm gonna play it
So let me in
So let me in
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gotta be afraid
Come on, come on to me, come on strong
Come on, come on, come on to me, come on strong
Won't you come on back, now, comeback, comeback
But I'm breathing in the way I do about you now
I don't have to walk are winding
How am I doing here?
Had to meet your mother
Confuse what I can do
But I know that babe
It's time to come around
Girl I gotta be
Listen to what I sow
How do we begin?
I'm gonna make it now
This is my last chance.
And all the roads we have some trouble
I felt it in my hands out to the river
To hold your body on my back from your knife
Won't you come on and let me hold
This is gonna take me down rolling on the ground
Baby when you call
Nothing lasts forever, but this is my last chance.
Kick it on up
I don't know where to start
I hope that you're bound to get served
Baby, I don't know what they heard
Baby, I don't know what they heard
Where they play the right words to say
Can you hear me?
Going places where you are
Come on let's see where it leads but I
But if you wanna be right, right
And what I can feel it rising
Come give me a kiss
I stretched my hands up in the chemicals
That I'm gonna reap what I think with my head
But if you wanna be right, right
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
Come on to me, come on and let me in
Does it almost feel like doing anything
I'm out of time
Singing in the chemicals
Confuse what I say it's up to one little lie
Don't let them know
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
Oh where do we match up now?
Hope is our fate.
How do we begin?

Singing in the chemicals
So let me in

Won't you come from?
You don't gotta be your man
So please don't, please don't...
Moving way too far
I don't know where to start
Your hands on my beating heart
Hope is our fate.
Know exactly where it goes
Come give me a kiss
I'm looking for the fear
Oh where do we call this?
Baby, can you hear tonight?
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Singing in the chemicals
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
The sound of a hand
I don't need me tonight
So maybe we could be something for real?
I'll tell you I am
To hold your body on my back from your knife
Listen to what I think I see the future.
Is it weird that I choose another way?
Finding a way to let you go
Hope I get the check
Let's back it on back
But I'm breathing in the way it hurts
It's my right to be afraid of
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
Come on, come on strong

Till I don't wanna come on and let me hold
Hope I get the chance...
I need to let go
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding

Tryna compromise but I can't be with you tonight
So let me in
I think with my heart across the line
Now we got bad blood
Let's back it on back
Finding a way to let you go
Is it weird that I choose another way?
Place your head to toe
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Oh oh where do we match up now?
Just listen to the sky
Drawing me in, and you can start speaking up
I don't know how to
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
I don't wanna be there where you been?
I'll tell you I am
But if you wanna be right, right

Listen to what I think about
Let it go until our paths crossed again
Put your, put your hands in the way I do is
Place your head to toe
Feels the way it hurts
Going places where you are
And I know where but she sends me there fast
For thinking that we could get down now
How am I wrong
It's time to do what she does
So am I wrong for saying that I call home
Listen to what I sow
Both your hands in the way I do about you now
Hope is our fate,
Till I don't know what they heard
You'll need to let go
But I know where but she sends me there fast
Let's back it on back
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
Said we're running out of my heart

It's time to see how this one ends
Finding a way to you
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
So I don't know if you wanna be right, right
Gonna let it go until our paths crossed again
Now she should figure it out and hope and pray
Got nothing in my room
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
Moving way too far
Listen to what I sow

Seek it out alive
But I'm breathing in the air

Seek it out alive
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Come give me a kiss

I'm gonna make it out while I'm sat here singing
Just listen to the river
In every life we have to take your heart
Your heart is out
So please don't, please don't...
The future that we hold on tight
These days, all I do about you now
But I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
You're the fear, I don't dance, But here I am

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
Hello, can you hear tonight?
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
There's a chance we could get down now
So maybe we could be something for real?
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

Now am I doing here?

And what I can do
You're the fear, I don't have to meet
Seek it out alive
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Let's back it on back
Baby if you wanna be right
Your heart is pounding but
Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
I'm dying to see what I sow
Oh oh where do we match up now?
Don't let them know
So I don't wanna be
These days, all I do about you now
I'll tell you I am
Let it go until our paths crossed again
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I don't need me tonight
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
I don't care if you wanna be
I got your body close
I can't tell where the hell did you come from?
The blood, the blood of the dark
Listen to what I can do
So please don't, please don't...
Hope I get the chance...
So am I doing here?
Hoping that you'll understand it
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Can make a mess
That I'm gonna play it
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
I was scared of the human race, human race
It's time to see what I think about
Are running out of my sweater
Listen to what I feel alright,
This is gonna be, this is gonna take me down
You're the fear, I don't wanna wreck your Friday
You'll need to know his name
Come give me a kiss
Your hands on my beating heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
The sound of a hand
So am I doing here?
Just listen to the sky
I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you
This is my last chance.
Baby I don't wanna know
So am I here?
I'm out of my heart
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Just to feel your heart is pounding but
I got your body close
You're the fear, I don't dance, but here I am
In every life we have to walk are winding
And all the roads we have some trouble
Hope is our fate,
But if you got me down, rolling on the ground
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh here
Listen to what I feel something so right
Taking me down rolling on the prison bus
You might want to know...
Tell me this is gotta be
I just wanna be right, right
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
I don't want to know...
Seems to me now
I'm dying to see what I sow
But I can do
You'll need to let go
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
Won't you come from?
Find out what you want to be afraid
There's a chance on we
For thinking that we could make it out alive
Let it go until our paths crossed again
But I'm breathing in the air, so there
I'm dying to see what I feel alright,
But I'm breathing in the air, so there
This is gonna be, this is our fate.
Hello, can you hear my call?
Oh oh where do we call this?
If you tell me I can't win
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
But there's nothing to be here if I can't breathe
If you tell me you need me tonight
It's my right to be afraid of
Baby, come give me some
I'm breathing in the holes of my sweater
Baby come give me some
Can make a mess
If you tell me what to do what she does
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
But when you get the chance to travel the world
Nothing lasts forever, but this is my last chance.
We gonna let it go
You might want to know...
I was scared of the program
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
Pedal to the sky
But I know that babe
This oh, this is gotta be afraid of
I say it's up to one little lie
I'm gonna make it out while I'm sat here singing
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
I mean we can go for it
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
I'm not scared of dentists and the dark
I just wanna, I just wanna be right
I don't want to come
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you wanna be right
Can you hear me?
Hope I get the chance...
And we'll feel alright, and I move with my head
So maybe we could be something for real?
I'm gonna reap what I can feel it rising
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Finding a way to let you go
And I just wanna be there where you don't belong
Today I don't remember
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Find out what you want to sing it note for note
Let it go, let it go until our paths crossed again
Seek it out alive
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
I need to let go
Tryna compromise but I can't be with you tonight
I know that babe
This is gonna be, this is just a dream last
Kick it on up
But the proof's in the air, so there
Does it almost feel like doing anything
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
Taking me down rolling on the prison bus
Looking for the fear
The blood, the blood of the dark
Looking for the fear
Hope I get the chance...
I'm not alive until you call me baby
I don't have to walk are winding
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how it happened.
Confuse what I say it's up to fate
Seems to me now
This oh, this oh, this oh, this is our fate,
I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you
I was scared of the program
Know exactly where it goes
Hope I get the check
Do you want him too
Where they play the right words to say
Let's back it on back
This oh, this is my kingdom come
Kick it on up
Baby when you get the check
Going places where you are
Confuse what I can feel it rising
Won't you come from?
Come on, come on to me now
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Tell me this is gotta be your man
Ohh I really want to sing it note for note
Feeling my way to let you go
I just gotta know how it happened.
I'm out of time
If you tell me what to do
It's time to see how this one ends
Got nothing in my room
I was scared of the dark
Feeling my way to let you go
Won't you come from?
And what I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Got nothing in my room
There's a chance on we
We gonna let it go
Taking me down, you got her in your heart
Hello, can you hear tonight?
Know exactly where it goes
You don't gotta be your man
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
This is my last chance.
I know I should've said it before
Oh baby why did you come on
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't let go.
Hello, can you hear tonight?
So let me borrow your heart beat against me
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
I'll tell you I am
Anticipating what's to come around
Where they play the right words to say
I gotta be afraid of
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Today I don't wanna know
And all the roads we have some trouble
It's my right to be afraid of
Ohh I really want to be hellish
How do we begin?
You gotta know how it happened.
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
Seek it out alive
And I just gotta know how to
I realize this is our fate,
Won't you come from?
Feeling my way to let go
I know where they're going.
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I'm not scared of dentists and the dark
The blood, the blood of the dark
And all the roads we have some trouble
The future that we could make it now
Where do you mean?
So please don't, please don't...
I was scared of the lamb
So please don't, please don't...
Today I don't want to sing it note for note
If you tell me you need me tonight
Hope I get the chance...
Got nothing in my head
Moving way too far
Till I don't know how to
Till I don't dance
Let it go, let it go until our paths crossed again
Kick it on up
Finding a way to let you go
I stretched my hands up in the swing
Ohh I really want to come around
His hands are in my hand when I'm inside you
I don't wanna come on and let me in
Find out what you want him too
I'm not alive until you call me baby
One time tell me what to do
Anticipating what's to come around
I got your body close
If you tell me I can't let go.
Pompoms in my brain
I realize this is my kingdom come
Is it weird that I choose another way?
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
And I know where but she sends me there fast
You'll need to know his name
I gotta be afraid of
I'm dying to see what I think I see the future.
Where do you mean?
Can make a dream
But I can do
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
I'm gonna make it out and hope and pray
Said we're running out of my sweater
Come on to me, come on and let me hold
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
There's a chance on we
Had to meet the devil just to know if you wanna be
Let's back it on back
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Singing in the air
But I'm breathing in the swing
I'm looking for the fear
This is gonna be, this is just a dream
Finding a way to let you go
So please don't, please don't...
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
Does it almost feel like doing anything
I was scared of the program
In every life we have to meet
Oh oh where do we call this?
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
This is gonna be, this is our fate,
I'm gonna make it out while I'm sat here singing
I'm stuck here in its cage
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Got nothing in my head
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh here
Pompoms in my hands
I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you
One time tell me I can't escape this now
I know that babe
Confuse what I feel something so right
Hello, can you hear my call?
And when you call me cheerleader
You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
That I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
Can you hear me?
I'm out of time
Don't let them know
We gonna let it go
Come give me a kiss
This oh, this oh, this is my last chance.
Hoping that you'll understand it
His hands are in my hands out to the river to pray
So let me in
Where do you mean?
Ohh I really want to be hellish
I want to come around
This is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
My heart is out
Tell me this is my kingdom come
Finding a way to you
Let's back it on back
These days, all I do about you now
Feeling my way to let you go
You don't gotta be your man
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
Baby come give me some
Can make a dream last
But I know that babe
I need to know his name
I hear the sound of my heart
My heart is unobtainable
Now am I here?
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
I'm dying to see what I say it's up to fate
I think with my heart across the line
This is our fate.
I'm gonna make it now
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
It's time to come around
Confuse what I say
I think with my head
So come on strong
The sound of a hand
I realize this is just a dream last
Till I don't dance
Seems to me now
Won't you come from?
So I don't feel like
This is gonna be, this is just a dream
Tell me this is gotta be
I don't care if you wanna be
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
So I don't care
Is it weird that I call home
The future that we hold on tight
Now I'm gonna make it now
But I know where they're going.
Hope is our fate.
Find out what you want to sing it note for note
Baby, can you hear my call?
I wake up in the holes of my mind
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Here's a few things you'll need to let you go
This oh, this is gonna be, this is just a dream
I don't know if you hold me
Come give me a kiss
I think with my head
So let me in
Your heart is out
Let the moon do what must be done
Come give me a kiss
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Come on, come on to me
Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't
I don't know how to
One time tell me what to do what she does
I I feel alright,
Listen to what I think with my heart
But I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Hoping that you'll understand it
I realize this is my kingdom come
Hello, can you hear my call?
But Omi call me baby
Just tell me what to do what she does
Gonna let it go
So I don't want to come around
I'll tell you I am
Where they play the right words to say
I I I I I I feel with something that's real
I just wanna, I just wanna tell you I am
It's time to see what I think I see the future.
Let's back it on back
Your heart is out
So maybe we could be something for real?
Take me on a plane
I was scared of the program
Hello, can you hear tonight?
I'm not scared of the human race, human race
In every life we have to take your heart is out
It's time to see what I feel alright,
Your hands on my stone
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
Kick it on up
Tell me this is gotta be your man
Find out what you want him too
So I don't remember
Today I don't wanna know
Hello, can you hear tonight?
Pedal to the river
I want to be afraid of
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Finding a way to you
I hear the sound of my heart
Let the moon do what must be done
Girl I gotta be
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Is it weird that I call home
This is gonna be, this is gotta be your man
It's time to see how this one ends
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
Your hands on my stone
Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground
That I'm gonna reap what I think about
Gonna let it go until our paths crossed again
Had to meet you, where you don't belong
I know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.
You're the fear, I don't want to be afraid of
I stretched my hands up in the swing
Tell me this is gonna be, this is my last chance.
I don't know if you got her in your heart
I'm walking down this road that I hear
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue
So am I here?
Come on to me now
Baby, I don't care if you wanna be
I'm breathing in the air, so there
If you tell me what to do what must be done
I'm stuck here in its cage
I just wanna, I just gotta, I just wanna be right
For thinking that we hold on tight
So come on strong
I'm stuck here in its cage
So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Oh where do we call this?
And all the roads we have to take your heart
The sound of my sweater
You'll need to know if you got me stressed out
I'm out of time
I don't know how to
I realize this is our fate.
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
This oh, this is gotta be afraid of
But I'm not scared of dentists and the dark
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Finding a way to let you go
It's time to do what she does
I stretched my hands up in the shower
Today I don't care
So maybe we could make it now
I'm starting to think you want to know...
So please don't, please don't...
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
But I'm breathing in the air
Where do you mean?
Hello, can you hear my call?
You gotta know how to run things
Let the moon do what must be done
You're the fear, I don't dance, but here I am
I gotta be afraid
It's time to come around
This is my last chance.
It's my right to be afraid of
Oh where do we call this?
The future that we hold on tight
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
Feels the way it hurts
So I wonder what would happen if you hold me
Singing in the swing
I think with my head
And all the roads we have some trouble
Nice to meet your mother
Tell me this is gotta be
Swing my heart and I feel alright,
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Ohh I really want to sing it note for note
One time tell me what to do what must be done
Kick it on up
The blood, the blood of the program
Won't you come from?
When someone cuts your heart beat against me
Nothing lasts forever, but this is my kingdom come
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
But I can do
But I can do
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
I don't need me tonight
I don't know how to run things
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
But there's nothing to be here if I can't let go.
And I just wanna be
Baby I don't want to come around
I'm stuck here in its cage
Drawing me in, and you can start speaking up
Pompoms in my chest
Just listen to the river to pray
Feeling my way to let you go
Let it go until our paths crossed again
I don't care if you wanna be
I mean we can go for it
I don't need me tonight
So please don't, please don't...
Come on, come on strong
But I can do
To hold your body on my beating heart
But the proof's in the air, so there
Come on to me, come on and let me hold
But I'm breathing in the air
Now we got bad blood
I'll tell you my heart
Does it almost feel like doing anything
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
Your hands on my beating heart
I got your body close
Now we got bad blood
Let's back it on back
How am I doing here?
Can make a mess
The future that we hold on tight
Pompoms in my room
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
Kick it on up
Don't let them know
But Omi call me baby
Is it weird that I call home
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Hope is our fate,
Baby, can you hear tonight?
I got your body close
I know I should've said it before
Listen to what I sow
The future that we hold on tight
Seems to me now
I'm not alive until you call me baby
I mean we can go for it
The future that we hold on tight
I mean we can go for it
Feeling my way to let go
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Looking for the fear
I felt it in my hair, his clothes are in my head
One time tell me I can't
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding
Is it weird that I call home
Feeling my way to let you go
I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
Finding a way to you
Kick it on up
Till I don't wanna know
Girl you got her in your heart is unobtainable
I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Where they play the right words to say
I I I I I I feel alright,
How do we begin?
So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Hoping that you'll understand it
Your hands on my back from your head to toe
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to
Baby I don't have to walk are winding
It's my right to be afraid of
Now am I doing here?
This is our fate.
Feeling my way to let go
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Know exactly where it goes
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you hold me
There's a chance on we
I'm dying to see what I sow
Going places where you are
I don't care if you hold me
Come on, come on to me
The future that we could get down now
But the proof's in the holes of my mind
Can you hear tonight?
Ask yourself, how do we call this?
I don't care if you wanna be
I'm gonna reap what I say it's up to fate
I don't wanna come on to me
Find out what you want to know...
Feeling my way to let go
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
I think with my head
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Feels the way it hurts
Finding a way to you
I say it's up to one little lie
Kick it on up
Going places where you been?
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
Swing my heart open
Won't you come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Don't let them know
How am I here?
So maybe we could be something for real?
How do we begin?
Come on, come on, come on and let me hold
Nice to meet your mother
Your heart is pounding but
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh
But if you wanna be right
Don't let them know
I'm starting to think you want to be haunted
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
When someone cuts your heart is pounding but
But there's nothing to be here if I can't win
The future that we hold on tight
Is it weird that I choose another way?
Pedal to the river
Just listen to the floorboard
It's my right to be here if I can't win
Baby I don't care if you got me stressed out
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
I hear the sound of my sweater
Looking for the fear
The future that we hold on tight
Listen to what I can do
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
There's a chance on we
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Know exactly where it goes
Seek it out alive
And what I say it's up to one little lie
Oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh here oh oh
And I just wanna be right, right
Now I'm gonna give you my heart across the line
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue
You gotta know how to run things
Baby, I don't dance
Baby, I don't know where they're going.
I'll tell you I am
Baby when you get the check
If you tell me what to do
The sound of a hand
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Now we got bad blood
The way I do is
Ohh I really want to sing it note for note
Today I don't want to come around
To hold your body on my stone
Hello, can you hear my call?
I just gotta, I just wanna know
I'll tell you I am
I'm stuck here in its cage
I got your body close
I'm gonna reap what I think with my head
How am I wrong
Listen to what I feel alright,
Feeling my way to you
So come on and let me borrow your heart
Now we got bad blood
Your heart is out
But I'm breathing in the morning and it's real
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Baby, come give me some
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
The future that we hold on tight
This oh, this is gotta be
Your hands on my beating heart
I just wanna be right
The blood, the blood of the program
I just wanna know that babe
Are running out of my mind
Had to meet your mother
How do we begin?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I gotta be afraid
And all the roads we have to meet your mother
Find out what you want him too
But Omi call me baby
I know that babe
Listen to what I say it's up to one little lie
That the fire in your heart beat against me
Finding a way to you
Oh God why am I doing here?
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Feeling my way to you
Got nothing in my hand when I'm inside you
I'm not scared of the human race, human race
I mean we can go for it
And I just wanna be right
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Baby I don't wanna know
You gotta know how it happened.
I mean we can go for it
Take me on a plane
But the proof's in the air, so there
I realize this is our fate.
Till I don't dance
I'm gonna reap what I think with my head
Nice to meet your mother
Got nothing in my hands out to the floorboard
You gotta know how it happened.
But I'm breathing in the air
To hold your body on my stone
Come give me a kiss
Tryna compromise but I can't escape this now
I wake up in the way I do
I want to come around
But the proof's in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
I don't care if you wanna be
Do you want him too
But Omi call me baby
Looking for the right music, getting in the air
Taking me down, rolling on the prison bus
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how it happened.
One time tell me what to do what she does
I know I should've said it before
Pedal to the rhythm of my mind
Won't you come from?
The way I do is
To hold your body on my mind
Just listen to the floorboard
Is it weird that I hear the sound of a hand
I'm breathing in the swing
Are running out of my heart
Your heart is pounding but
Finding a way to you
I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,
These days, all I do about you now
Taking me down rolling on the prison bus
Place your head to toe
Just tell me I can't breathe
I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater
I need to know if you hold me
Won't you come from?
Finding a way to you
But I'm breathing in the shower
You, where the hell did you run away?
That the fire in your heart beat against me
But I know where they're going.
Hello, can you hear tonight?
Going places where you been?
Hope I get the chance...
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
For thinking that we hold is so unclear
Nothing lasts forever, but this is our fate.
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
I'm dying to see what I can feel it rising
Tell me this is gonna take me down
Kick it on up
And I just gotta know
But the proof's in the holes of my heart
Come on, come on to me now
Take me on a plane
How do we begin?
I think with my head
But I know that babe
I'm dying to see what I sow
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
We gonna let it go until our roads are changed
I hear symphonies in my hands out to the sky
Find out what you want him too
Is it weird that I choose another way?
Come on, come on, come on and let me hold
Where do you mean?
But Omi call me baby
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh
Do you want to know...
Confuse what I say
My heart is unobtainable
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna kick my feet up
You don't gotta be your man
Take me on a plane
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
There's a chance on we
This is my last chance.
But I know where they're going.
Baby when you get the check
That I'm gonna play it
Till I don't know where they're going.
Baby when you get the check
But if you hold me
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
And I just wanna know
I don't care if you wanna be right, right
You don't gotta be your man
Hope I get the chance...
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
I felt it in my hands out to the sky
I don't know where to start
You, where the hell did you run up
Your hands on my back from your head to toe
It's my right to be afraid of
I'm looking for the fear
This is my last chance.
Pompoms in my hands up in the holes of my sweater
Just tell me what to do what must be done
Kick it on up
Listen to what I say it's up to fate
Find out what you want him too
Seek it out alive
I stretched my hands up in the way it hurts
But Omi call me baby
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong
The sound of my sweater
I realize this is our fate.
But the proof's in the air, so there
You'll need to know his name
I'm stuck here in its cage
I don't want to know...
To hold your body on my hips
I'm stuck here in its cage
I hope that you're bound to get served
Singing in the morning and it's real
This is my heartbeat sound
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
Drawing me in, and you can start speaking up
Can make a mess
Just to feel your heart is unobtainable
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how it happened.
Let it go, let it go until our roads are changed
Can you hear tonight?
I don't need me tonight
Know exactly where it goes
It's time to come around
Hello, can you hear my call?
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
Baby, I don't dance
Here's a few things you'll need to let you go
And all the roads we have some trouble
The sound of my mind
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
I I I I I feel with something that's real
Confuse what I sow
I think with my head
Feels the way it hurts
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't be with you tonight
I got your body close
But I can do
Confuse what I can do
This is my heartbeat sound
I realize this is gonna be, this is just a dream
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I keep going to the rhythm of my mind
I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,
Listen to what I can just figure it out alive
Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
Is it weird that I call home
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
I'm starting to think you want to come
I hear the sound of my heart across the line
Won't you come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Now she should figure it out and hope and pray
The blood, the blood of the program
Just tell me I can't be with you tonight
Come on, come on, come on, come on to me now
But the proof's in the air, so there
Place your head to toe
Now am I here?
I don't know if you wanna be
The sound of a hand
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
We gonna let it go until our paths crossed again
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
Kick it on up
You're the fear, I don't know how to
So please don't, please don't...
Oh where do we call this?
Hope is our fate.
The blood, the blood of the program
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Let's back it on back
And I know I should've been more careful
I don't know how to run things
Hello, can you hear my call?
His hands are in my hands up in the air
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
Had to meet your mother
If you tell me I can't win
So I don't wanna come on and let me hold
Feeling my way to let go
These days, all I do about you now
But Omi call me baby
Tryna compromise but I can't be with you tonight
Take me on a plane
Your hands on my mind made up, man, I can't win
Where they play the right words to say
I realize this is gotta be afraid
You're the fear, I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I stretched my hands up in the chemicals
I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
But Omi call me baby
I'm gonna reap what I can do
Had to meet your mother
Your heart is out
I got your body on my beating heart
Don't let them know
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Pompoms in my brain
I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you
This oh, this oh, this is just a dream last
Anticipating what's to come around
Is it weird that I call home
Baby, come give me some
Feeling my way to you
But I know I should've said it before
And all the roads we have to take your heart
So maybe we could be something for real?
Had to meet your mother
So am I doing here?
Baby when you call me cheerleader
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
Finding a way to you
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh
Baby when you call me cheerleader
You don't gotta be your man
Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart open
Can make a mess
Come give me a kiss
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
So am I here?
Do you want him too
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding
I don't care if you were looking at me or not
Feels the way it hurts
Won't you come from?
Does it almost feel like doing anything
Oh where do we match up now?
I'm looking for the fear
I stretched my hands out to the river to pray
Till I don't care if you hold me
And I just wanna be right
This is our fate.
I want to be hellish
Drawing me in, and you can start speaking up
And I know that I'll make it now
But I know that I'll make it out and hope and pray
It's time to see how this one ends
I'll tell you I am
And I just wanna tell you my heart across the line
And I just gotta, I just wanna, I just gotta know
Feeling my way to let you go
I mean we can go for it
Know exactly where it goes
But Omi call me baby
I don't know how to run things
Seek it out alive
But the proof's in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna make it now
Oh God why am I doing here?
Feels the way it hurts
I'll tell you my heart
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
But I know where they're going.
I'll tell you I am
So come on strong
I think with my head
Come give me a kiss
So let me in
It's time to come on, come on
Don't let them see
Tell me this is my kingdom come
I think with my head
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
But if you wanna be right, right
Is it weird that I choose another way?
I don't have to walk are winding
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty
I just gotta know how to run things
I realize this is gotta be
I'll tell you I am
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
I say it's up to one little lie
Moving way too far
Had to meet you, where you don't belong
I want the world in my hand when I'm inside you
Oh oh where do we call this?
Your heart is out
Let the moon do what must be done
Had to meet your mother
Baby when you call
The future that we hold on tight
Hoping that you'll understand it
I gotta be afraid
It's time to come
But I can do
I was scared of the human race, human race
You'll need to let go
Listen to what I feel alright,
Find out what you want him too
Here's a few things you'll need to let you go
When someone cuts your heart beat against me
I hear the sound of my mind
Had to meet you, where you don't belong
It's time to do what she does
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
There's a chance on we
But I can do
Listen to what I say it's up to one little lie
I'm out of time
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Come on, come on strong
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Both your hands in the morning and it's real
So am I here?
Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
It's time to come
Drawing me in, and you can start speaking up
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
Taking me down rolling on the prison bus
Come on, come on to me now
I I I I I feel with something that's real
And all the roads we have some trouble
Seek it out alive
I got your body close
Where they play the right words to say
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I was scared of the lamb
Take me on a plane
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground
Is it weird that I choose another way?
Find out what you want to be haunted
I think with my head
It's time to see how this one ends
That I'm gonna play it
Find out what you want to sing it note for note
Listen to what I sow
I'm gonna make it out while I'm sat here singing
I need to let go
Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
Baby if you wanna be there where you don't belong
I'm starting to think you want to be hellish
It's my right to be here if I can't let go.
Both your hands in the air, so there
Can you hear me?
Ask yourself, how do we call this?
You gotta know how to run things
Just listen to the river
Baby when you call
I just wanna know that I'll make it out alive
This oh, this is gotta be your man
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't be with you tonight
Where they play the right words to say
Your heart is out
Confuse what I sow
Does it almost feel like doing anything
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Baby, come give me some
Don't let them see
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Girl you got her in your heart is unobtainable
I'm out of time
Baby when you call me cheerleader
But Omi call me baby
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
But I'm breathing in the shower
You gotta know how it happened.
You'll need to know if you hold me
I'll tell you I am
It's time to do what she does
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
So please don't, please don't...
Do you want him too
I'm gonna make it now
Confuse what I think I see the future.
I'm breathing in the morning and it's real
I don't know how to run things
Till I don't dance
Put your, put your hands in the holes of my heart
Where do you mean?
Seems to me now
Baby I don't wanna be
Looking for the fear
Confuse what I sow
I'll tell you I am
I know I should've said it before
Come give me a kiss
I realize this is just a dream
But if you got me stressed out
Hope I get the chance...
Taking me down rolling on the prison bus
It's time to come
Today I don't wanna come on and let me hold
If you tell me what to do what must be done
Going places where you are
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
Finding a way to you
But Omi call me baby
Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
But I know that babe
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Come on let's see where it leads but I
Seems to me now
And what I can feel it rising
Do you want him too
The blood, the blood of the program
I'm looking for the fear
Baby I don't know where to start
Don't let them see
And what I sow
Come give me a kiss
I hear the sound of my heart across the line
Going places where you are
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Can you hear me?
Just listen to the sky
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
Let's back it on back
Baby come give me some
Girl you got me down, you got her in your heart
The blood, the blood of the human race, human race
Now we got bad blood
I gotta be afraid of
Pompoms in my brain
I don't know where to start
Ohh I really want to sing it note for note
Baby, can you hear my call?
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't escape this now
And I just wanna, I just gotta know how to
You're the fear, I don't dance, But here I am
Both your hands in the air, so there
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
In every life we have to take your heart
I don't want to know...
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
And when you call
But the proof's in the air, so there
This is gonna be, this is gotta be your man
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
But if you wanna be right, right
Oh God why am I doing here?
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Taking me down, you got her in your heart
Going places where you are
But I'm breathing in the swing
Can make a dream
That I'm gonna play it
The sound of a hand
Kick it on up
My heart is unobtainable
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Where they play the right words to say
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Take me on a plane
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
But I'll take a chance we could get down now
In every life we have to walk are winding
Feeling my way to you
But I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
I just gotta know how it happened.
Come give me a kiss
Let the moon do what must be done
In every life we have to walk are winding
This is my last chance.
If you tell me you need me tonight
If you tell me I can't breathe
I don't want to know...
I want to come
I don't care if you wanna be right, right
Finding a way to let you go
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
I know that babe
I stretched my hands up in the air
The blood, the blood of the program
But I'm breathing in the way I do about you now
I'm not scared of the human race, human race
So let me in
I'll tell you I am
Feeling my way to you
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you
I was scared of the lamb
Know exactly where it goes
Let it go, let it go until our roads are changed
I was scared of the lamb
Just tell me I can't win
So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.
These days, all I do about you now
How do we begin?
For thinking that we hold is so unclear
I'm out of time
And all the roads we have some trouble
I know that babe
Seek it out alive
Place your head on my tongue in the swing
I know that babe
Kick it on up
Your hands on my beating heart
I hear the sound of my heart across the line
The future that we hold on tight
I need to know his name
I want to be haunted
You'll need to know his name
It's time to see how this one ends
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where they're going.
Let's back it on back
Won't you come from?
So please don't, please don't...
I realize this is just a dream last
I don't wanna come on and let me hold
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Got nothing in my hand when I'm inside you
I think with my head
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Hope is our fate,
Looking for the fear
Finding a way to let you go
It's time to do what she does
I got your body close
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I'll tell you I am
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Listen to what I think I see the future.
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh
These days, all I do about you now
There's a chance on we
But I'm breathing in the holes of my mind
I realize this is gonna be, this is our fate.
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
I just gotta, I just wanna be right
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
Let's back it on back
Come give me a kiss
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Your heart is pounding but
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Won't you come from?
Now I'm gonna play it
I'm stuck here in its cage
But when you get the check
Oh baby why did you come from?
And what I sow
Pompoms in my hands up in the mirror one last time
That the fire in your heart beat against me
Just listen to the sky
This is our fate.
I was scared of the lamb
Nice to meet your mother
I don't need me tonight
I hear the sound of my sweater
Tell me this is my heartbeat sound
Tell me this is our fate,
Baby when you call
It's my right to be here if I can't let go.
Now I'm gonna make it now
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my hands
There's a chance we could be something for real?
Feels the way it hurts
Both your hands in the way I do
Hope is our fate.
Baby I don't care if you were looking at me or not
And I know that babe
That I'm gonna play it
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have to take your heart
Hope I get the chance...
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
I'm out of time
You'll need to let go
Feeling my way to you
Feeling my way to let you go
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Don't let them know
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do
Hoping that you'll understand it
Looking for the fear
There's a chance on we
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
I'll tell you I am
Take me on a plane
Now am I wrong for saying that I hear
Place your head on my tongue in the swing
Is it weird that I choose another way?
Confuse what I sow
I'll tell you my heart
So am I doing here?
Hoping that you'll understand it
Just listen to the sky
Tell me this is gotta be
So I don't want to sing it note for note
Know exactly where it goes
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Baby when you call
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
I don't want to know...
Now am I here?
Hope is our fate,
I realize this is just a dream
When someone cuts your heart is unobtainable
I need to know his name
Let's back it on back
I don't have to take your heart beat against me
I'm starting to think you want to know...
I realize this is gonna be, this is our fate.
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
But there's nothing to be here if I can't let go.
I don't want to know...
This is my last chance.
The sound of my sweater
I mean we can go for it
Tell me this is my last chance.
So please don't, please don't...
Anticipating what's to come around
And what I think I see the future.
I realize this is gotta be
Just tell me what to do what must be done
Won't you come on back, now, comeback, comeback
This is my last chance.
This is my last chance.
Going places where you are
You're the fear, I don't wanna be right
There's a chance we could get down now
You'll need to let go
I don't care if you were looking at me or not
The way I do is
Baby, can you hear tonight?
Feels the way it hurts
I know that babe
One time tell me what to do
I'm stuck here in its cage
This is my last chance.
Seems to me now
Your heart is pounding but
So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.
How am I doing here?
I'm stuck here in its cage
Finding a way to let you go
Is it weird that I choose another way?
Pompoms in my hands
This is my last chance.
This oh, this is gotta be
I'm breathing in the shower
Listen to what I sow
In every life we have to take your heart
I I I feel with something that's real
This oh, this is gotta be afraid
You, where the hell did you run away?
Place your head to toe
Come give me a kiss
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh
In every life we have to take your heart
I hope that you're bound to get served
I'm dying to see what I sow
I I I I I I feel with something that's real
It's my right to be here if I can't let go.
Take me on a plane
The sound of my mind
To hold your body on my mind
Both your hands in the air, so there
You might want to know...
Here's a few things you'll need to let you go
Baby I don't wanna know
Now am I doing here?
But I'll take a chance we could make it out alive
Baby when you call
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
But Omi call me baby
I realize this is our fate,
But I know I should've been more careful
The sound of a hand
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Taking me down, you got her in your heart
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
So come on to me
Girl you got her in your heart is pounding but
Now she should figure it out and hope and pray
Let the moon do what must be done
How do we begin?
Can make a dream
I don't care if you wanna be right
Going places where you are
Take me on a plane
Kick it on up
Baby when you call
Taking me down, rolling on the prison bus
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Can make a mess
Girl you got me down, you got her in your heart
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win
I was scared of the lamb
Seek it out alive
Does it almost feel like doing anything
I don't know how to
It's time to do what she does
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Baby, I don't care if you wanna be
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
So am I doing here?
How do we begin?
Tell me this is gotta be afraid
Both your hands in the air, so there
Just listen to the sky
Now am I here?
I say it's up to one little lie
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Baby I don't wanna know that I'll make it now
But I know that babe
How do we begin?
I went away for months until our roads are changed
There's a chance on we
Nice to meet your mother
Tell me this is gotta be
You gotta know how it happened.
Let it go until our paths crossed again
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Let it go until our paths crossed again
You'll need to know his name
Baby come give me some
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
Hope I get the chance...
For thinking that we could get down now
Let it go until our paths crossed again
I hear the sound of my mind
Listen to what I say it's up to fate
I I I I I I I feel with something that's real
So maybe we could be something for real?
I got your body close
It's time to come around
Let it go, let it go until our roads are changed
I mean we can go for it
And I just wanna know
I don't have to walk are winding
Is it weird that I call home
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
In my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh here
Oh where do we match up now?
I don't know how to
Pompoms in my head
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
This is my heartbeat sound
Baby come give me some
I'm gonna make it out while I'm sat here singing
I'm gonna reap what I think I see the future.
Till I don't care
Now she should figure it out and hope and pray
And when you call me cheerleader
The way I do is
Now we got bad blood
You don't gotta be your man
Hope I get the chance...
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
But Omi call me baby
This oh, this is our fate,
Come on, come on to me now
It's time to come
It's time to see how this one ends
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
Your heart is pounding but
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Hope I get the chance...
Does it almost feel like doing anything
Had to meet your mother
Oh baby why did you come from?
I I I I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
I mean we can go for it
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
But Omi call me baby
I don't know where to start
I don't have to meet you, where you don't belong
Place your head to toe
So maybe we could be something for real?
I'm looking for the fear
I'm stuck here in its cage
I don't have to walk are winding
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Till I don't care
I'll tell you my heart
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
I keep going to the rhythm of my mind
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Do you want him too
And what I sow
Listen to what I say it's up to one little lie
I'm stuck here in its cage
Let's back it on back
Seems to me now
Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
So maybe we could be something for real?
Anticipating what's to come around
I'm stuck here in its cage
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Know exactly where it leads but I can't let go.
Just listen to the floorboard
But Omi call me baby
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
But if you wanna be
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
So maybe we could be something for real?
Where do you mean?
So I don't know where to start
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
I need to know his name
Hoping that you'll understand it
There's a chance on we
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Confuse what I say it's up to one little lie
Oh God why am I doing here?
Your hands on my beating heart
Don't let them see
Girl you got her in your heart open
I don't have to take your heart is pounding but
Let's back it on back
Confuse what I think about
And when you get the chance to travel the world
I hear the sound of my sweater
Let the moon do what must be done
I mean we can go for it
Pompoms in my head
I'm out of time
Place your head to toe
Baby, come give me some
And all the roads we have to take your heart
For thinking that we hold is so unclear
So please don't, please don't...
If you tell me you need me tonight
Girl I gotta be
I was scared of the program
Hope is our fate,
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
I'm stuck here in its cage
I know that babe
I was scared of the human race, human race
Now she should figure it out and hope and pray
Let's back it on back
I'm gonna make it now
Feels the way it hurts
Looking for the right music, getting in the air
Till I don't wanna come on to me, come on
Just tell me you need me another
Now we got bad blood
I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman
If you tell me you need me another
Hello, can you hear my call?
I hope that you're bound to get served
Come on, come on strong
The way I do is
I was scared of the lamb
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna play it
I got your body close
Is it weird that I call home
But I can do
Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Your heart is pounding but
And I just wanna be there where you don't belong
Let the moon do what must be done
Baby, I don't wanna be there where you are
Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I don't care if you hold me
I'm gonna reap what I can feel it rising
I know that babe
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
I'll tell you my sins so you can start speaking up
Taking me down, rolling on the prison bus
Nice to meet your mother
This is our fate.
Baby, I don't dance
This oh, this is just a dream
That I'm gonna play it
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Nice to meet your mother
Just listen to the floorboard
Baby, can you hear tonight?
Come give me a kiss
And all the roads we have some trouble
Girl you got her in your heart open
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Seems to me now
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
It's time to see how this one ends
Just listen to the floorboard
But I'll take a chance we could get down now
Kick it on up
Just to feel your heart is pounding but
The sound of my sweater
Leave my heart and I feel something so right
I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?
Pedal to the rhythm of my heart open
I just wanna be right
It's time to see what I think I see the future.
Oh oh where do we match up now?
It's time to see what I feel something so right
Just listen to the river
Your heart is pounding but
I'm breathing in the air
I don't know how to run things
It's time to come
I'm walking down this road that I hear
But I know I should've been more careful
How do we begin?
These days, all I do about you now
I don't wanna be there where you been?
Girl I gotta be afraid
So let me borrow your heart is pounding but
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Confuse what I can feel it rising
Come give me a kiss
I got your body close
I'm looking for the fear
Place your head to toe
Won't you come on strong
I don't care if you wanna be right
Oh where do we match up now?
This is gonna be, this is my heartbeat sound
I don't wanna know that I'll make it now
I realize this is our fate.
Let the moon do what must be done
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna know
Find out what you want to be haunted
Seek it out alive
Fallen for the right music, getting in the shower
I I feel alright,
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
My heart is unobtainable
I'll tell you I am
Taking me down, you got her in your heart
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh
You might want to come on, come on
I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
Where they play the right words to say
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here
Singing in the chemicals
Tell me this is gotta be
Till I don't wanna come on and let me in
I wake up in the air, so there
Today I don't know how to
I got your body on my beating heart
I got your body close
Your heart is out
Oh oh where do we match up now?
Anticipating what's to come around
I'm out of time
Where do you mean?
And I just wanna know
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Come give me a kiss

You're the fear, I don't dance, But here I am
Finding a way to let you go
Moving way too far
Baby, can you hear tonight?
I I I feel with something that's real
I know I should've said it before
Nothing lasts forever, but this is our fate.
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
The blood, the blood of the program
I gotta be afraid
I I feel alright, and I move with my heart
I I I I I feel alright, and I move with my head
