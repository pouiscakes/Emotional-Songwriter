And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If today I woke up with you right beside me
I'd hold you closer than I ever did before
Hey, hey
But look around
And I know now, that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
And I know now, that I'm so down (hey!)
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And I know now, that I'm so down (hey)
Your lipstick stain is a work of art (hey, hey)
And I know now, that I'm so down (hey, hey)
Hello, it's me
Hello from the other side
Hello from the outside
Hello, how are you?
Did you ever make it out of that town
It's no secret that the both of us
So hello from the other side (other side)
Hello from the outside (outside)
Hello from the other side (other side)
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it but really
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
But honestly I'd rather be
That I'll be here
So tell them I'll be here
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
So holla at me I'll be in the car when you're done
And I'm done talking
Well you can tell everybody
Go ahead and tell everybody
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
I believe every lie that I ever told
I played my cards and I didn't fold
Then he broke that mold so I know I'm blessed (this is my world)
[Hook:]
I'm the man
[Hook 3x:]
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh [x2]
Whoa, I'm never gonna give it up
Oo-o-o-o-oo
The sun was out 'til midnight
Oo-o-o-o-o
Nah nah honey, I’m good
You look good, I will not lie
So nah nah honey, I’m good
No, honey, I’m good
To another I will stay true
I got her, and she got me
Oh, I’m sure ya, sure ya will make somebody’s night
Oh, no, honey, I’m good
No, no, honey, I’m good
Oh whoa oh
And I know, and I know, and I know
I promise, after that, I'll let you go
I promise, after that I'll let you go
(Oh)
They say I'm caught up in a dream
[2x]
And I didn't know I was lost
And love is the prize
Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)
Nothing changed at all?
You've been here before?
Can you tell that you drive me crazy?
Think of you when I'm going to bed
When I wake up think of you again
You are my homie, lover and friend
Since you came you know what I've discovered
No, no all I know (know)
And you know that I got to have you
(Water)
There ain't no guarantee
There ain't no giving up
Tonight is bottoms up
Drop a tailgate on ya truck
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that
Never thought a country song would make you move like that, yeah
Hey dog check this out
Bottoms up
Damn right
Cause tonight it's bottoms up
And get up, drop a tailgate on ya truck
(Hey)
(Hey...)
Boom! Boom! Boom! Clap!
You're picture perfect blue
First kiss just like a drug
Under your influence
Boom! Clap!
I think I saw you
I think I see you
'Cause you're a sky, you're a sky full of stars
I'm getting drunk on a plane
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
'Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane
I'm drunk on a plane
She ain't ready for it
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Oh, Lord, who else sounded like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show
The other night, Lavish Lee told me
Askin' what was said and who was involved
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
And I know when that hotline bling
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
you, you got exactly what you asked for
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
Right now, you're someone else
She sees them walking in a straight line, that's not really her style.
He sees them talking with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue.
Whoa [3x]
Ah lahmlahlah
I met this girl late last year
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
I told her she knows
All over the track like a feature
And those shows have never been what it's about
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
[Knock knock knock] on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
And I never saw him as a threat
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
Inside the pocket
And it's the only thing that I know (know)
Inside these pages you just hold me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
It's late in the evening
Won't you let me know
Sing!
I told her my name and said, "It's nice to meet ya."
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila.
I already know she's a keeper
One thing led to another
Before the beat kicks in again
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh [x7])
My friends had you figured out
Yeah, they saw what's inside of you
You tried hiding another you
But your evil was coming through
And that's when my love was burning
Yeah, it's still burning
I turn around and you're creeping in
Oh you never told me
True love was gonna hurt
Well, I had me a boy, turned him into a man
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand
Whoa, and then I let him go
Ex's and oh's
Some legends are told
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
I'll keep you like an oath
But they’re not quite what they seem
And may death find you alive
In Gem City we turned the tide
You get your hands in it, plant your roots in it
(Dirt, dirt, dirt...)
Build your corn field, whiskey bonfires on it
(Dirt)
That postgame party field you circle up on
The mud on her jeans that she peeled off and hung up
You've stuck some crosses and some painted goal posts through it (dirt, dirt, dirt...)
You know you came from it (dirt)
And someday you'll return to this...
You know you came from it and someday you'll return to it
Ooh, you
But for you
Oh, for you
The list goes on
I'll, I'll up and run
Oh, to you
Ooh, oh
But, for you
Ooh, I'd lose it all
My lover's got humour
Knows everybody's disapproval
Offer me that deathless death
She demands a sacrifice
Something meaty for the main course
What you got in the stable?
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
No Masters or Kings
Only then I am clean
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried!
Well, now they know!
Turn away and slam the door!
I don't care
It's funny how some distance
And the fears that once controlled me
And here I'll stay
Look into my eyes
And the masquerade
Though this is all for you
They say it's what you make
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa
Whoa oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
And it's a hundred and three between her and me and only 92 in Daytona
Ha ha aww yeah...a little palm tree leaning
White sand, cold can, koozie in my hand
Burnin' it down
Sippin' on some cold Jack Daniel's
I'm just doing my thing
You love it when I sing
Girl when you want it, you know that I'm on it
I wrote this song just looking at you ooh, oh
Remind me of a Kanye West song?
Kanye West song
Is it weird that your bra
Remind me of a Katy Perry song?
(And they playing for you girl)
Is it weird that your eyes
Remind me of a Coldplay song?
Coldplay song
I wrote this song looking at you ooh, oh
Oh, yeah
I wrote this song (I wrote this song) just looking at you
Ooh, oh (Just looking at you girl)
I got the sheets on the floor
Nothing on me
It's a hundred degrees
I got one foot out the door
I tipped the driver ahead of time
You open the door
I'm on your magical mystery ride
My head's under water
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
I'll give my all to you
Even when I lose I'm winning
And you give me all of you, oh oh
You're my downfall, you're my muse
And you give me all of you
Hey yeah
Spent all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So cover your eyes,
I have a surprise
I'll give you a taste
Make it like your birthday everyday
I know you like it sweet
So you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate
I'll make it like your birthday everyday
I'll be your gift
Pop your confetti
Pop your Pérignon
All night they're playing
We're doing it right
Happy birthday
So let me get you in your birthday suit
It's time to bring out the big balloons
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
You held me down, but I got up (HEY!)
I see it all, I see it now
Louder, louder than a lion
I went from zero, to my own hero
(You'll hear me roar)
Oh up, up all night long
You're a different, different kind of fun
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a lifetime
Turned it on
Oh, I could do this for a lifetime
Oh, up, up all night long
Hey!
Momma and daddy put their roots right here
Growin' up in little pink houses
(Hey!)
Born in the U.S.A.
I'm gonna take you down
I'm gonna show you how
And caught up in this world
I was born without this fear
I open my mouth and it's something I've read
I stood at this door before, I'm told
But a part of me knows that I'm growing too old
Confused what I thought with something I felt
Far away
Hey bartender pour 'em hot tonight
Hey bartender
Tonight I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
But before it goes too far I'll let him down easy
So pour that thing up to the top
Hey Bartender
That's what I always thought
Guess you got me in the palm of your hand
I've never been this far
And waltzed away with my heart
Guess you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Yah, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Ooooh...
Thinkin’ about her under your bed sheets
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s pullin’ you in
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece.
And we'll never be royals (royals).
That kind of luxe just ain't for us.
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule.
We count our dollars on the train to the party.
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this,
We didn't come from money.
We're bigger than we ever dreamed,
The hounds will stay in chains
Call all the ladies out
Dancin' around big eyes as well
And you know, we're on each other's team
And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
So there
I'm kinda older than I was when I revelled without a care
We're on each other's team
And you know, and you know, and you know
Z71 like a Cadillac
There ain't nobody
Into a party
Eight up in a four door
Burnin up a back road song
Back it on up
Bar downtown, they got a line
Of people waiting out the door
Ten dollar drinks, it's packed inside
That's what's up up
Thinkin', "No way she ain't got one."
She jumped up and cut me off
She was like, "Oh, my God, this is my song.
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again."
And I said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again."
Before I walked her to the door
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is."
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
She was like, "Oh my God, this is my song.
Saturday morning jumped out of bed
Knocked on your door with heart in my hand
To ask you a question
To another galaxy, you know
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
Lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on...
Hunt you down eat you alive
But we get along when I'm inside you
Whoa...
I was there for you
Oh oh oh
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest time
Oh, in your darkest nights
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
Yeah, my mama she told me "don't worry about your size"
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top
Yeah my mama she told me, "don't worry about your size"
(Awwwww)
And don't forget the flowers every anniversary
'Cause if you'll treat me right
Buying groceries
Buy-buying what you need
I never learned to cook
But I can write a hook
Sing-sing along with me (hey)
You gotta know how to treat me like a lady
Buy me a ring
(Woah! Hey.)
(That's right!)
Oh-woah
You come in to look for a king
You're in the mood for a dance
I'm stronger than I've been before
Thought on your body
I came alive
It was lethal
It was fatal
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
(Oh, my my, what)
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations) (Oom bop bop)
Na na na na na, na na na (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Do do do do do, do do do (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Here's a little song I wrote
Somebody came and took your bed
He may have to litigate
(Look at me I'm happy)
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
Now there, is this song I wrote
I hope you learned it note for note
In your life expect some trouble
Well, here comes a comeback
And there goes my hero
He's an underdog, he's coming out on top
She came to raise the dead
And now I'm nowhere, she's somewhere else
Said you're on and on, she sees but I say
Hey, here comes a comeback
And there goes my hero, he's an underdog
Hey
I've never been laid so low
Never been laid so low, low, low, low
Uh!
Just chillin' in my snuggie
Oh, yes I said it
I said it
Nothing at all!
Nothing at all
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait
Haha
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And now you're in my way
I wasn't looking for this,
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But still, you're in my way
I didn't know I would feel it,
But it's in my way
And you should know that
And go like this
Ee-yah twist
My daddy is sleepin'
And mama ain't around
Yeah, daddy just sleepin'
Come on and twist
She really knows how to rock
She knows how to twist
Yeah, twist on down
Twist
I believe in a thing called love
One, two, three, four
Oh, you're changing your heart
Oh, You know who you are
Sweetheart bitterheart now I can't tell you apart
Oh, you know who you are
Oh, who you are
I'll be giving it my bestest
I reckon, it's again my turn
I'm yours.
Well, open up your mind and see like me,
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours.
Oh, I'm yours
Oh, oh,
Baby, do you believe, I'm yours?
You best believe, you best believe, I'm yours.
They paved paradise
Then they charged the people
Hey, farmer, farmer,
That white gold
This one for them hood girls
Them good girls
Stylin', wilin
Livin' in up in the city
Got chucks on with Saint Laurent
Say my name you know who I am
Hey, hey, hey, oh!
Fill my cup put some liquor in it
Jump on it
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (say whaa?!)
Aaaaaaow!
You were a child
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
I guess not
They all tell me that there’s something strange
(This is what it sounds like)
Whoa-oh-oh, I’m alive
Through the San Francisco night
Like Jay-Z, Beyonce
Whoa-oh-oh
And it sounds like
That's why;
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down...
I opened up my hand
Sing;
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Back beat, the word is on the street
There are many things that I would
But I don't know how
And after all
Realized what you're not to do
There are many things that I would like to say to you
Yeah you held my hand,
Didn't understand,
As I dove into the waterfall.
Well we rushed it,
Well I'm just a boy,
And it sets us free.
Bombs away! [x3] (Say Geronimo! [x4])
Jubilation,
She loves me again,
Early in the morning, risin' to the street
Love is what I got
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin', is what I got, now remember that
Lovin', is what I got
Lovin', is what I got, I got I got I got
Which was my place and which was not
Thought I had a good shot
So, put a posy in your hair
Pretend you couldn't give a care
She don't know she shines for us
Something tells me that she does
Love, lower your eyes
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've got to find
Remy Boyz

Say oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
And they say
Do you think I'm pretty
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a model

She thinks I made the right selection
I could show you incredible things
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
I can read you like a magazine
So hey, let's be friends
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
Rose garden filled with thorns
"Oh my God, who is she?"
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
I said, "You're holding back,"
She took my arm,
We took the floor and she said,
Deep in her eyes,
You make it look like it's magic, oh, yeah
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
The way you work it
You're my favorite kind of night
Oh, hey, oh
Oh, baby, are you listening?
But when you're near me
God knew exactly what he was doing
I came in like a wrecking ball
And now, you're not coming down
Oh whoa-oh-oh-oh
[Tony:]
Like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this
I'm a pick you up in a Cadillac
Out of my league
Old school chic
Like a movie star
I never met a girl like you ever 'till we met
A star in the 40s, centerfold in the 50s
Got me tripping out like the sixties
Whoa oh oh (Yeah, yeah)
My face above the water
To find a way
All I am is a man
She knows what I think about
Just us, you find out
Inside this place is warm
Whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa... whoa
Whoa, whoa... [2x]
Big dope dealer money, he was getting some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Look at, look at, look at
Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
You got me in chains
But I wouldn't change
No, I wouldn't change this love
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
Alone in the night 'til she knocks on my door
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, hey-ey-ey-ey)
(You got me in...)
I wouldn't change this love
I'm getting red in the face
Oh (that's why)
Oh, oh
Am I tripping for having a vision?
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul
And baby you're a boat
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showing off
She's heading for something that she won't forget
And I've been thinking about it lately
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
[Harry (along all):]
Old but I'm not that old
Young but I'm not that bold
I'm just doing what we're told
Old but, I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one.
but mama raised me good, mama raised me right.
Oh, we all run for something.
For diamonds, for dust.
I don't mind letting you down easy
Ain't it fun living in the real world
You might be the one who's running things
Ain't it fun
(Down to your mama)
(Oh, this is the real world)
This is the real world
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go
Ohhh, oh no
Well you let her go
Like a small boat
And all those things I didn't say
Prove I'm alright song
I'll play my fight song
And it's been two years
Still believe
Yeah, I still believe
Prove I'm alright song (Hey!)
How do we call this love (whoa oh oh oh)
Why do we call this love (whoa oh oh oh)
How do we call this love? (whoa oh oh oh)
To make it easy, you lie
And say it's all for love (whoa oh oh oh)
Whoa oh, whoa oh
It's just me
Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
We're gonna have a house party
So I'll be at your door in ten minutes
They say nothin' good happens here
Your kiss has got me wired
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
This DJ's on a roll
[Regular version:] It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
[Video version:] It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old train
And not say, "Hi"
And I know your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
You don't know me
But you're still here
And I'm still here
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I can't believe you let me down
You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I've known what you've done
Even though Lord knows you kept mine
'Cause you don't think Ive known what you've done
And I know
And I don't know
Yes, I do, I believe
And it's hard
I'll take care of you
I'm reaching out to you
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
Oh, won't you stay with me?
This ain't love, it's clear to see
And deep down I know this never works
[3x]
Sometimes a shadow wins
And since your history of silence
Won't do you any good,
Did you think it would?
You got me sippin' on something
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
And I'll bet the odds against it all
No happy endings
I thought that I'd been hurt before
Move on
Oh, I'm just holding on for tonight
And I might have thought that we were one
I'm still fighting for peace
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
And I will stay up through the night
And I know that I can survive
So take a look what you've done
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you
So take a look what you've done (look what you've done)
It's like I got this music
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
Hey, hey, hey
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah.
I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."
He says, "What you've heard is true but I
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
Say you'll remember me
Say you'll see me again
I said, "No one has to know what we do."
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
You'll see me in hindsight
I don't care I'm down for what you want
So put it on me
Anything you want I'll give it up
Put it on me
Hey...

Girl I know you ready I ain't even gotta check
Girl you had good, but I could give you better
I'm a make you say

I know you got all dressed up for the club
Baby, when I saw ya walking out the door
I just knew ya needed something more
So, shawty, let your hair down, and take a sip
So tell me when you ready
Just for a second
[Hook]
Oh, all my friends are turning green
Oh, oh, and they come unstuck
There's this movie that I think you'll like
Running wild and running free
And I said hey
Rebels and mutineers
Spielbergs and Kubricks
And even though your friends tell me you're doing fine
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
The world is made up of many colors!
