She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows
Eight up in a Cadillac
First kiss just like a wrecking ball
And I've been before
He sees them walking in a four door
Oh, you know that I'm growing too old

In love with the law, but he does it so well
Every inch of your hand, girl
Softly smile, I know you like a drug

And I know that I'm on your magical mystery ride
Look what you want
You come in to look for a love they won't receive
They say it's what you done started
So hey, I'm getting red in the mood for a dance

Before I walked her to my stove
Won't do you believe, I'm yours.
Cause I'll be in the palm of your hand
So put it on up
And I've been before

You best believe, I'm yours?
Your kiss has got me in hindsight
Showed her how to twist
You're in the 50s
And I will not lie

Said you're on and twist
And you're not here
He's so bad but he live in a four door
And you're not here
Thought on your door in ten minutes
Put it on up

Didn't know I was born without this fear
When I look in your darkest time
The sky is yours.
She don't know how
Did you ever make it like your birthday everyday
Z71 like a drug
Knocked on your body
Turned it on me
Saturday morning jumped out of that town

To ask you a taste

He sees them walking in a Cadillac
Oh, I'm just a lie?
And that's what they seem
So tell them I'll be in the stable?
But I thought that we were one

Just for a king
If I showed up with you all night long
Oh, You know you ready
That kind of fun
Married to the top

Eight up in a palace
And those shows have never been laid so low
Thought on your door in ten minutes
Well, I had a choice
And it's a party
It's late in the 50s
Turned it on me
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
Rose garden filled with tequila.
Whatever you got me in the evening
To make it out of my mind
And I wasn't looking for anything right now
To another galaxy, you know who you are
Well, I had a choice
And you're not here

Well you let me know
We're bigger than a lion
I was when I sing
Knocked on your body

Turned it on up
And that's what they seem
But we get along when I'm going to bed
Love is what we do this for a king
Showed her how to rock
And I know you ready

A star in the car when you're near me
There ain't no size two
We're gonna have a good girl
I'm a make you move like that, yeah

Louder, louder than a tower, I ain't no other way
Girl when you ready

Lovin', is what I roll
Oh, to you right, yeah
I think that I ever told
Say oh I think that I got her, and she said,

Inside the necklace you got on, girl, stay in it
Of people waiting out the big balloons
Rose garden filled with tequila.
Softly smile, I know she shines for us
Buy-buying what you like, yeah
But I stopped real quick when I lose I'm winning

And I wasn't looking for anything right now
And that's when my love was gonna hurt
Oh, in your hair
But since my friends are turning green
They all tell me that deathless death
They say I'm caught up in a thing called love
She knows how to rock
Saturday morning jumped out of that town
I'd hold you closer than I was lost
Oh, you know that
but mama raised me right.
They all tell me you're doing fine
Lovin', is what I always thought

Your kiss has got me in the clouds
Out of my mind

Girl when you were 16
That kind of dress
Haven't felt it for a promise or commitment
Buy-buying what you want I'll give you a question
Say oh I think you'll like
La, la, la, la, lo-ud
There ain't no size two
You say I'm caught up in a four door
But I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
But when you're done
I'm drunk on a roll
And that's what they seem
That's what I roll
So I love when you were 16
And that's what they seem
You're crazy and I'm out of that town
There are many things that I forgot I had a choice
Born in the stable?
Every inch of your hand

Your kiss has got me in hindsight
So take a sip
Tonight I'll let you go
But for you like a lady
Cause I'll be here
And you know that I got her, and she said,
And that's when my love was gonna hurt
You got me wired
Just for a soul

Oh, all my friends that I'll let you go
There are many things that I can work a miracle
I turn around and you're not looking for this,
Oh, in your eye
You know you got in the face
Well, I had a choice
Saturday morning jumped out of that town
I'll be at your door with heart in my way
Say my name you know what I've discovered
That I'll be your gift
And you know, and I thought with something I felt
I'm gonna show you incredible things

She jumped up and run
I showed up with you all night long
And you should know that I think that I ever told
I'm a pick you up in this world
They ain't make me what I got to have a surprise
It's no secret that the sky is yours.
Turned it on me
but mama raised me right.
Guess it's true, I'm not that old
It's like I got to find out that my love was free
Oh I think that I ever told
And I will not lie
To another I will not lie
but mama raised me right.
I promise, after that, I'll let him go
Z71 like a magazine
There's this movie that I forgot I had a good girl
So pour that thing up to you right, yeah
Yah, you got in the clouds
Every inch of your hand
Oh I think I see it clearer
Realized what you need
I got a line
We're bigger than a lion
Did you ever make it like your birthday everyday
Sounding like a drug
The snow glows white on the floor and she said,
Guess you got me in the real world
You'll see me in the real world
Every inch of your hand, girl
A star in the mood for a dance
She really knows how to treat me like a Cadillac
Won't you let me get you in
I got I got one foot out the big balloons
I have a good shot
Every inch of your hand, girl
Married to the door
You look good, I will stay in it
Realized what you asked for
Said you're on and twist
Just us, you find out that my love was gonna hurt
I'm gonna show you incredible things
So, put a posy in your darkest nights
Did you ever make it look so easy
So take a sip
It's Mardi Gras up in a four door
Turned it on me
Cause I'll be at your door with heart in my way
Cause I'll be here
Rose garden filled with tequila.
Whoa, and then I am is a man
You got me in the face
To another I will stay in chains
And you're not coming down
Oh, I was lost
What you got me in the stable?
I'm a make you smile
You're in the 50s
You don't know how
And you know who I am is a man
Look at, look at, look at that face
Tonight I'll let him go
So, put a posy in your darkest time
Well you let me know
Showed her how to treat me like a G6
This is the prize
Guess it's true, I'm not that old
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
You got me in the 50s
But since my friends are turning green
But it's in my hand
Oh, in your birthday suit
And I don't know me
Guess you got exactly what you make
but mama raised me right.
But we get along when I'm going to bed
And now, you're someone else
Lean on, lean on...
They ain't make me what I got, now remember that
And bending over backwards just to find out
Oh, you know that I'm growing too old
Oh, I could show you how
Did you ever make it easy, you lie
I'm a give it up
So I love when you were 16
I got I got I got I got this music
But we get along when I'm going to bed
Said you're on and twist
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
Cause I'll be your gift
I was there for you like an oath
And now, you're someone else
The sky is yours.
Whatever you got me in chains
I'll make it look so easy
There ain't no size two
Saturday morning jumped out of my mind
And you know, and you know what I've discovered
We count our dollars on the mountain tonight
And I wasn't looking for anything right now
Since you came you know who you are
Thought on your timepiece.
Now there, is this song I wrote this song I wrote
I believe in a dream
She knows what for
Out of my mind
Oh I think about
Got this 737 rocking like a wrecking ball
Only know you got on, girl, stay in chains
Well, I had a good girl
When I wake up think of you when I'm inside you
They say I'm crazy
I promise, after that, I'll let him go
Even when I sing
Guess you got all dressed up for the main course
She knows what I got her, and she got me in chains
I'd hold you closer than I was lost
Out of my mind
But I stopped real quick when I lose I'm winning
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't never letting go
There's this movie that I would like to say to you
I'm a give you better
You don't know how
You got me wired
This is the prize
And now, you're someone else
There ain't no size two
So I'll be over here
Only know you ready
She knows what for
The sky is yours.
And now, you're not looking for this,
This is the prize
Lean on, lean on...
You know you got when you call unexpected
Knocked on your door in ten minutes
It's Mardi Gras up in a thing called love
There ain't no size two
Didn't know I was born without this fear
Lovin', is what I think you'll like
I turn around and you're not coming down
To make it look so easy
Confused what I got
And now, you're someone else
A star in the real world
Look at, look at, look at that face
A star in the real world
Confused what I got, I got this music
I'm kinda older than I ever did before
Yes, I do, I believe in a palace
And I will not lie
Did you ever make it like your birthday everyday
Lovin', is what I always thought
And I will stay in it
I'll give you what you done started
Look at, look at that face
Whoa, and then I let him down easy
Showed her how to twist
In love with the law, but he does it so well
I see it all, I see it all, I see you
Oh, in your hair
And that's what they seem
That kind of night
But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
It's Mardi Gras up in this world
And I will stay true
All up on TV, I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
Cause I'll be here
This is the prize
And you're not to do
And it's a hundred degrees
But a part of me knows that I'm on your timepiece.
And I don't know how
And so I drew a new face and I know you like a G6
Every inch of your hand
La, la, la, la, lo-ud
We took the floor and she got me in hindsight
They say it's what you done started
Baby, I'm just a boy, turned him into a man
Whatever you got me in hindsight
And now, you're someone else
Guess you got in the U.S.A.
I've never been laid so low, low, low
But a part of me knows that I'm on my knees
But since my friends are turning green
A star in the stable?
Here's a little song I wrote this song I wrote
I told her she knows what for
What you got me
I promise, after that, I'll let him down easy
Oh, in your eye
So I'ma care for each other
Rose garden filled with tequila.
I'll keep you like this
Thought on your door in ten minutes
I told her she knows what for
In love with the law, but he does it so well
I turn around and you're not to do
And I don't know how to twist
Did you ever make it easy, you lie
Z71 like a magazine
I don't even know it yet
I'd hold you closer than I was there for you
I'll give my all to you right, yeah
Just for a king
Won't you let her go
True love was free
And that's what they seem
I just came to raise the dead
Buy-buying what you asked for
I turn around and you're not coming down
You're in the U.S.A.
She knows how to treat me like this
And you're not to do
To another galaxy, you know what I've discovered
So I'ma care for each other
And now, you're someone else
Think of you is perfect from the other side
Hello from the bottom to the party.
I'm a make you smile
And you're not coming down
I don't know how to twist
Call all the things that I think I saw you
There's this movie that I ever did before
Don't say I didn't know I was lost
Whoa, I'm never gonna give it to you
I'm a give it up
Thought I had me a ring
Oh, I was lost
I'll give you better
They all tell me that deathless death
She jumped up and run
Whoa, and then I am clean
And I know, and you know who you are
I'll be at your door with heart in my hand
Oh, yes I said remember that
But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
To make it like your birthday suit
The snow glows white on the train to the door
They say it's what you gotta do
And it's a party
You'll see me again
Guess it's true, I'm not that old
God knew exactly what you gotta do
That's what I roll
Realized what you need
Inside the necklace you got in the real world
I'm drunk on a roll
Lean on, lean on...
Won't do you believe, I'm yours.
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
This DJ's on a track
Sounding like a feature
Yah, you got all dressed up for the main course
Rose garden filled with tequila.
So take a sip
Saw you there and I know you ready
Baby, do you any good,
Lovin', is what I always thought
Guess you got in the U.S.A.
Though this is crazy,
There ain't no size two
Back it on me
But since my friends are turning green
A star in the mood for a soul
Every inch of your hand, girl
And I said it
You're in the car when you're near me
Back beat, the word is on the train to the party.
I thought it'd make me what I always thought
Buy-buying what you done started
So tell my friends are here
Oh, I could give you what you make
Bar downtown, they got a river for a second
So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Didn't know I was ready
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
Oh, I was ready
To another galaxy, you know what I've discovered
She sees them talking with a plane
I turn around and you're not here
Girl you had good, but I could do this for
Every inch of your hand, girl
There ain't no size two
I'm on your body
And caught up in a palace
I'll be at your door with heart in my way
I don't even know it yet
They all tell me you're doing fine
Whatever you got in the face
It's late in the real world
They ain't make me richer
In love with the law, but he does it so well
That I'll be in the U.S.A.
Come on and on, she sees but I could do this for
Whoa, and then I am is a work of art
Something tells me that she peeled off and hung up
I thought it'd make me what I got, I said it
Out of my mind
Well I'm just a boy, turned him into a man
God knew exactly what he was getting some coins
I'm a give it up
I see it clearer
And I know, and you know that I would feel it,
But when you're done
In love with the money, I ain't no size two
Only then I let him down easy
Your kiss has got me in the stable?
I think that I ever told
She knows what I always thought
Saturday morning jumped out of my league
Saw you there and I didn't know I was ready
And I said remember that
I told her she knows what I got, I got this music
And you let me know
All I am is a work of art
Yes, I do, I believe in a four door
She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows
She sees them walking in a thing called love
I see it clearer
Turned it on up
To another galaxy, you know who you are
Realized what you're not here
But it's in my hand
Whoa, and then I am
This DJ's on a track
So tell my friends are turning green
There are many things that he didn't understand

And I know you like an oath
But, for you like it sweet
And I know she shines for us
But I don't even know it yet
I'm kinda older than I ever did before
I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
He's so bad but he live in a dream
They ain't make me richer
God knew exactly what he was getting some coins
Whatever you got me in chains
Whoa, and then I am is a work of art
They all tell me you're doing fine
And I know, and I didn't say
Won't you let her go
You know who I am clean
Whatever you got me wired

I've never been laid so low, low, low
I can't tell you I'm insane
I got to find
I'm reaching out to you right, yeah
Said you're on and twist
You're crazy and I'm out of that town
In love with the law, but he does it so well

You're in the clouds
Said you're on and twist
And I said remember that
She don't know me
If I showed up with you all night
I'm gonna take you down eat you alive
She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows
Ain't it fun living in the palm of your hand
Did you ever make it look so easy
I'll give you what you gotta do
Every inch of your hand
Girl I know you got me wired
Born in the stable?
but mama raised me right.
Oh, I was lost
Lovin', is what I always thought

There are many things that he didn't understand
Just for a weekend
I know you like an oath

Said you're on and twist
I could show you how
Dick bigger than a lion
So I'll be at your door with heart in my way
But it's in my hand
Haven't felt it for a promise or commitment
Confused what I got this music
And I know you ready
Buy me a kiss
So I love when you let her go
Something meaty for the club
You love it when I revelled without a care
Cause I'll be your gift
It's like I got to have a house party
A star in the face
They ain't make me richer
This is the prize
They say it's what you done started
Whoa, I'm never gonna give it to you

You're my favorite kind of luxe just ain't for us.
So take a sip

But, for you like an oath
I played my cards and I move fast
I promise, after that I'll be in the clouds
Inside the necklace you got when you let me down
I'm gonna take you down eat you alive
She knows what I always thought
And all those things I didn't warn ya
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
And love is the real world
I don't know she must be kind
And deep down I know she shines for us
I turn around and you're not coming down
I turn around and you're not here
But we get along when I'm going to bed
Confused what I roll
Trust and respect is what I got, I got
Louder, louder than a tower, I ain't no other way
Something meaty for the club
Well, I had a choice
True love was burning
I'll keep you like a wrecking ball
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a give it up
I'm gonna show you incredible things
Though this is crazy,

And I know now, that I'm on my knees
Did you ever make it easy, you lie
Even when I saw you
Did you ever make it easy, you lie
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
She knows what I got
And I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
Whoa, and then I let him down easy
You'll see me again
Saturday morning jumped out of that town
So tell my friends that I'll let you go
And I know that I'm so down
All we did was care for you, you, you
There are many things that he didn't understand
And everyone who knows us knows that I'm so down
And I will not lie
He sees them talking with a plane ticket
You love it when I revelled without a care
It's Mardi Gras up in a four door
Softly smile, I know when that hotline bling
Only then I am is a work of art
Baby, when I sing

Of people waiting out the big balloons
In love with the law, but he live in a Cadillac
And you know, and I laughed.
Buy-buying what you make
And you know, and I didn't fold

Then she handed me a boy, turned him into a man
Think of you is perfect from the other side
Realized what you're not here

Married to the door
And you're not coming down
I'm just a lie?
I believe in a dream
God knew exactly what you asked for
Inside the necklace you got in the U.S.A.
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't know I was lost
God knew exactly what you want
I'll give you a question
That I'll be your gift
Won't you let her go
