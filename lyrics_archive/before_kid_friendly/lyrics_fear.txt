Tell me this is just a dream
Simmer down, simmer down
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
Let's get out, let's get out
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
Hello, can you hear me?
I hope that you're well
Where nothing ever happened?
Are running out of time
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And we'll discuss our big dreams
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand it
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Somewhere I heard that life is a test
It's time to do what must be done
I stretched my hands out to the sky
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gotta be
But if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I gotta bid you adieu
(Now check it out)
Sing it now
I know I should've fought it
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
One last time
Can't you forgive me?
I should've been more careful
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
When I'm wiser and I'm older
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
Not afraid to close my eyes
Does it almost feel like
How am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Oh where do we begin?
The rubble or our sins?
Oh oh where do we begin?
And the walls kept tumbling down (oh where do we begin?)
Gray clouds roll over the hills (oh where do we begin?)
Bringing darkness from above (the rubble or our sins?)
I don't know, it's just something about ya
I be feeling as if I'm around ya
Singing in the shower
Baby I don't need me another
But I'll take a chance on we
Baby let's take our time
Looking for the law, while I push my luck
Get up
Kick it on back
Damn
Girl I gotta tip my hat
Everybody feelin alright
To my heartbeat sound
The sound of my heart
Come on to me, come on to me now
Just tell me what to do
I'm gonna give you my heart
Told her about my condition
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
But right now
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
Fuck that, I've been ready
Damn, okay, from that perspective
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Going places where you don't belong
These days, all I do is
And she says,
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where they're going.
And he says,
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear."
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She's singing
I don't wanna know that babe
Singing out Aretha
But we should get on a plane
Now she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
Where our eyes are never closing
'Til our eyes meet
Next to your heartbeat
Where I should be
Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
To hold your body close
For the longest time lady
Come on set the tone
Oh-Oh-Oh-Ooh-Oh
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushing through you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Let it go until our roads are changed
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh
Can you feel it?
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
I keep going to the river to pray
Had to meet the devil just to know his name
I keep going to the river
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
We, we don't have to worry 'bout nothing
Light it up, like we're the stars of the human race, human race
When the light started out they don’t know what they heard
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Du du...
Some turn to dust or to gold
Is all it will take
Come on, come on and let me in
You're about to bloom
The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
That plowed up ground that your dad damned his luck on
Drift a cloud back behind county roads that you run up
You
Baby if you hold me
They fear they'll lose so much
My church offers no absolutes
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen.
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
That's a fine-looking high horse
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
When the Ritual begins
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Let it go, let it go
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
And the blood's run stale
This is my kingdom come
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
At the curtain's call
Will come calling out
Don't wanna hide the truth
I say it's up to fate
I need to let you go
I can't escape this now
I'm breathing in the chemicals
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Beachin'
Just to feel your heart beat against me
I hear symphonies in my head
Is it weird that I hear
(Damn) Is it weird that I hear
(I hear symphonies in my head)
Come on, come on, come on
Where are my keys?
Get me there fast
I got your body on my mind
I want it bad
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
But I'm breathing fine
What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh
Said we're running out of time
Where do I start
Ohh I really want to know...
Tryna compromise but I can't win
Ohh I really wanna know...
I want to know...
Oh
Ohhh
And every tomorrow, maybe you'll let me borrow your heart
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Now how about I'd be the last voice you hear tonight?
I heard you're feeling nothing's going right
The clock is ticking, running out of time
It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
Get ready 'cause I've had enough
'Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You're gonna hear me roar
(You're gonna hear me roar)
You're gonna hear me roar...
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
You, where the hell did you come from?
Now, I've got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
I can feel it rising
Your hands on my hips
Baby, come give me a kiss
Now he's sittin' out back, 30/30 in his lap
Baby come give me a kiss
Come with me now
Afraid to lose control
I think with my heart and I move with my head
Confuse what I feel with something that's real
I heard him say (come with me now)
Check the mirror one last time
What I'm really needing now
Till I don't remember
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock
Oh what I'm really needing now
I don't dance, But here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
I don't dance
Ooooh
I don't dance, but here I am
I gotta heart rush, ain’t slowin’ down
I got it real bad, want everything she has
I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
I gotta heart rush, it ain’t slowin’ down
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams.
It don't run in our blood,
Let me live that fantasy.
It don't run in our blood
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll send the call out
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air, so there
'Cause what this palace wants is release
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the air
Come on
We go way out where
We turn this cornfield
Pedal to the floorboard
Let's tear it up up
I don't know what they're waitin for
And it's like knock knock knock goes the diesel
Let's back it on up
Kick it
Let's kick the dust up
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is."
Say yes, say yes 'cause I need to know
Tough luck, my friend, but the answer is 'No'
Or we will run away
Tough luck, my friend, 'cause the answer's still 'No"
Tough luck, my friend, but 'No' still means 'No'!
What will we do when we get old?
Will we walk down the same road?
Taking me down, rolling on the ground
That comes alive when I'm inside you
Taking me down rolling on the ground
Yo...
Ow
Oh baby why did you run away?
But I wonder where were you?
So I wonder where were you?
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
But I'm here to tell you...
Dear future husband
You'll need to know if you wanna be
Take me on a date
Tell me everything's alright
Dear future husband,
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you wanna be
Just apologize
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
And when you get the chance...
I should've said it before
I only wanna die alive
In my dreams it felt so right
I hear the sound of a gentle word
Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
I don't know where but she sends me there
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
(Don't worry)
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
So don't worry, be happy
Listen to what I say
I'm not worried, I'm happy
So come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Singing that's my dog, that's my dog
That's my dog
Here comes a comeback
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I'm gonna kick my feet up
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't
I might mess around, and get my college degree
No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
Where do you think you're going, baby?
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe!
Try to chase me,
At first sight and it's real
Where you think you're going, baby?
Let's do the twist
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty
You should see my my litlle Sis
My heart's in overdrive and you're behind the steering wheel
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
You got me in a spin but everythin' is A.OK!
Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
Too scared to own up to one little lie
It cannot wait,
I'm sure.
This is our fate,
Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
It's what we aim to do.
So please don't, please don't, please don't...
'Cause our time is short.
This oh, this oh, this is our fate.
Please don't take my sunshine away
Please!
I said
Doh
This hit
Call the po-lice and the fireman
Break it down...
Take a sip, sign a check
If we show up, we gon' show out
Come on, dance
Don't brag about it, come show me
Control yourself
A family of trees wanting to be haunted
But it's sending me shivers
Decisions too
Decisions are made and not bought
Here we go
I can’t afford the rent or remember checks I sent
Hop into my car and drive like
I wake up in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
Here I am,
You gotta little work or a twenty to lend?"
Feels the way I do about you now
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
The way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
Feels the way I do
About you now
I said maybe
Let the moment take us while we hold on tight
let the moment take us while we hold on tight
If we bridge this gap,
You were waiting,
So say Geronimo!
Moving way too fast.
We can make this leap,
So Say Geronimo!
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Try and test that you're bound to get served
I, oh, I, oh
Let the moon do what she does
I trust the signs so I may find my way to you
Maybe just the touch of a hand
And I just wanna tell you I am
Place your head on my beating heart
Hoping that you'll understand
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
You're the fear, I don't care
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
RGF production
If you checking for my pockets I'm like
ZooWap
I need it now
I'm something weak
I just wanna be there where you are
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Make it alright
Come give me some
I'm right here,
'Cause I need
I want that red velvet
I gotta be your man
You don't gotta be afraid
Yes, please (please)
But Omi call me cheerleader
Pompoms in my hand when I'm singing this song
You gotta know how to
Nice to meet you, where you been?
Love's a game, wanna play?
And I know you heard about me
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Or it's gonna go down in flames
We'll take this way too far
Find out what you want
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
The chemical, physical, kryptonite
I don't know how it happened.
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me.
I think I see the future.
I realize this is my last chance.
Shit
Wondering where you've been all my life
Baby, can you hear me?
I'm scared oh, so scared
I could do this for eternity
Hey! Where's the drums?
Let's go!
This world might've gone crazy
I'm out of my mind
Uuuuuuh uh uh
Pulling against the stream
I'm stuck here in between
I'm looking for the right words to say
I want the world in my hands
And what I think about
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
Sometimes the silence guides our minds
The goose bumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
Let me hold
Who wanna go first? I had 'em pushing daffodils
By the way, what he say?
Let him eat it with his grills,
He said he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
I'm starting to think you want him too
And I'm puffing my chest
It's my right to be hellish
'Cause you know I get excited, yeah
Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?
Am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home
So am I wrong
For thinking that we could be something for real?
Now am I wrong
If you tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't wanna be right, right
I don't wanna be right
Am I wrong
I'm not scared of the dark
They can't blind me
Changes into something red
Driving too fast
Just how fast the night changes?
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Moving too fast
Seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone
I give her hope
Inside
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
And I been waiting for this time to come around
I give her hope (give her hope)
But, baby I've been, I've been praying hard
Swing my heart across the line
Seek it out and ye shall find.
I I I I feel something so right by doing the wrong thing
Every thing that kills me makes me feel alive.
Baby I've been, I've been praying hard
Hope is our four-letter word, make that money watch it burn
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
And I feel alright, and I feel alright,
I got my mind made up, man, I can't let go.
Mama said, "Do what you want, say prayers at night,"
run for God, for fate,
If it don't hurt now then just wait, just wait a while
Where you're from
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
Sending big waves
Into motion
Can make a heart open
I might only have one match
Wrecking balls inside my brain
Everybody's worried about me
In too deep
A lot of fight left in me
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
One time tell me you need me tonight
How do we call this?
I don't know if you were looking at me or not
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
My heart is pounding but
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I don't have to take your heart
And some guy's getting too close
Come on let's see where it goes
I don't have to meet your mother
For better or for worse
But the proof's in the way it hurts
But when you call me baby
Your heart is unobtainable
You've made me realize my deepest fear
Where do I begin?
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong
And make sure you're alright
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
Can you hear my call?
Or you can start speaking up
But I wonder what would happen if you
Honestly, I wanna see you be brave
I wanna see you be brave
Fallen for the fear
Show me how big your brave is
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
Finding a way to let go
The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
But I know that I'll make it out alive
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe
Shaking, falling onto my knees
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
Gonna wind up dead
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Gotta get out now, gotta run from this
But your blade—it might be too sharp
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
And let's be clear, won't close my eyes
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Now we got problems
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife
Mhmmm
Got nothing in my brain
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
She's like "Oh, my god!" but I'm just gonna shake.
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah ohhh
Long drive,
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)
Know exactly where it leads but I
So it goes
He said, "Let's get out of this town.
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds."
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
My one condition is
Wildest dreams, ah-ha oh,
Wildest dreams, ah-ha oh.
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
Wildest dreams, ah-ha oh
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha oh
(even if it's just in your wildest dreams) ah-ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-ha.
Now if we're talking body
(Uh uh)
Put your, put your hands in the air
[Clean version:] If you keep shaking that, oh, oh
Baby when you ready tell the waitress get the check
(Hands in the air)
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I just wanna, I just wanna know
I just gotta, I just gotta know
Go forth and have no fear
Come close and lend an ear
Let's begin...
