[Calum:]
[Calum:]
[Luke:]
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
I made a mixtape straight out of '94
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart (hey, hey)
And a million miles
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
[Chorus:]
Yes I am, yes I am, yes I am
[Verse 1:]
God made my mold different from the rest
[Bridge:]
Be a king when kingdom comes
[Verse 2:]
I'll be the teacher you can be the lesson
I'm a soldier standing on my feet
[Ad lib:]
We danced with monsters through the night
(2, 3, 4)
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-ife
I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
But all the possibilities
I feel it in my soul (soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The best day of my life
It’s been a long night here, and a long night there
My baby’s already got all of my love
(ooh ooh I will stay true)
Drinking from that unholy grail
True ooo, ooo
[4x]
I will stay true
I gave in to the fire
I should've done you better
That you got everything,
One more time
I swear I'll make it worth it
At least I'm being honest (yeah)
I swear I'll make it worth it, babe
Life's a game made for everyone
Eheu aul aul [x8]
In the city that we love
Gray clouds roll over the hills
Bringing darkness from above
Eheu aul aul [x4]
In the city that we love (the rubble or our sins?)
Like the 4th of July
I always seem to smile
I'm dancing in the mirror n' singing in the shower
La-la-di, la-la-da, la-la-daaa
All I want, all I need is your loving
Baby you make me hot like an oven
Only you got me feeling so (so)
(Singing in the shower)
You bring my heart to life yeah
La-la-di, la-la-da, la-la-daaa (hey)
You got me singing in the shower
[Laughter]
I see you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde
Goin ninety five burning down one twenty nine yeah
Rock this quiet, little country town
Find a keg and fill ya cup up
Yeah tonight is bottoms up
And she's doing it in daisy dukes
Get em up, get em up, get em up
Hey y'all whatever ya sippin on,
Get it up in the air one time
Let's give a toast to the good times
When I met you in the summer
And we could be together baby
As long as skies are blue
Summer
(Summer)
(Love)
Sunbathing on the moon
Stars shining as your bones illuminate
You take me over you're the magic in my veins
This must be love
You make me feel good
Could dress me up so good
You're the glitter in the darkness of my world
I feel your love
You are the sun, the glowing halo
And you keep burning me up with all your love, uh
'Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars
'Cause in a sky, 'cause in a sky full of stars
Such a heavenly view
You're such a heavenly view
I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Got a little mile-high flight attention
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef. Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
Yeah
Late night when you need my love
you started wearing less and goin' out more
Yeah, they're living the good life, can't see what he is going through.
In the fast lane, living life without knowing.
A week later returned
Baby, bring a lemon and a bottle of gin.
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM.
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Four cities, two planes the same day
And all this time God knows I'm singing
[2x:]
Loving can hurt
We keep this love in a photograph
Holdin' me closer
Wait for me to come home
Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
We keep this love in this photograph
Wait for me to come home [4x]
Under the lamppost
Back on 6th street
"Wait for me to come home."
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
This love is a blaze
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Singing we found love in a local rave
Just from this one small act of kindness,
Sobering up we just sit on the couch
Bright light living in the shade
Your cold heart makes my spirit shake
Guess I love living in the sin
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK
Hey, hey, until I made my getaway
I had a summer lover down in New Orleans
Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring
I get high, and I love to get low
So the hearts keep breaking, and the heads just roll
Climbing over mountains and a-sailing over seas
They, they gonna see us from outer space, outer space
Strike the match, play it loud, giving love to the world
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the sky
'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire
Yeah we got the fire, fire, fire
And what we see is everybody's on the floor acting crazy, getting loco 'til the lights out
Music's on, I'm waking up, we fight the fire, then we burn it up
We can light it up, up, up
And we gonna let it burn
Du du du-du, du du du-du
He-e-e-ey ya, oh he-e-e-ey
He-e-e-ey ya
Mummified my teenage dreams
And you're a cherry blossom
We've been here forever
And here's the frozen proof
I can move mountains
And CK eternity, oh, hell, yes
Is worth two lions, but here I am
And I slept in last night’s clothes and tomorrow’s dreams
Dusty head lights dance with your boots in it
(Yeah)
It's that elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
Her blue eyed summertime smile looks so good that it hurts
... elm shade, red rust clay you grew up on
My house in Budapest
My, my hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful Castillo
My acres of a land
That I've achieved
And give me one good reason
My many artifacts
My friends and family
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom."
The only heaven I'll be sent to
But I love it
Command me to be well
[Chorus 2x:]
Good God, let me give you my life
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
We've a lot of starving faithful
Offer me my deathless death
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen.
A kingdom of isolation,
Makes everything seem small
I am one with the wind and sky
My power flurries through the air into the ground
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
The past is in the past!
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
In the light of day
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold
But with the beast inside
But I am hell bound
It's woven in my soul
Your eyes, they shine so bright
[Inhale, exhale]
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
I raise my flag and dye my clothes
We're painted red to fit right in
Deep in my bones, straight from inside
Laid back in a thrift store beach chair, droppin' limes in a Corona
And it's sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, slow tide rollin'
White sand, cold can, koozie in my hand, just a summertime strolling
Chillin', breezing, sippin', singin' whoa
We got 2-for-1s, we're at a Margarita bar, whatever happens happens
And there's a reggae band, full of dread heads, just sittin' in the corner laughin'
Well, my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a jar, she smiles and shakes it at me
Yeah, she gets 'em goin', she gets 'em playin' a little "Don't Worry, Be Happy"
I got a Margarita here in my hand, doin' a little drinkin'
Talkin' 'bout sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, slow tide rollin'
Chillin', breezing, sippin', singin' whoa,
Sunshine, blue eyes, tan lines, slow tide rollin'
We're just hanging around
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you, baby
Say it makes you feel like an angel
You know that I love lovin' up on you
Let's hit the switch and let our shadows dance
Laying right here dreaming in my bed
Baby girl, will you rock it out with me?
Jammin' to some old Alabama with you baby
And the trumpets they go
Da da, da ra ra da [x6]
oooh-ooh
(Ha, yeah)
[Background:] Da da, da ra ra da [x6]
(Go, go-go, go-go, go, go-go)
They go, oh-ooh, yeah
In the back of the cab
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you (baby)
Get up, get up!
What's going on in that beautiful mind
[Pre-Chorus:]
Loves all of you
All your perfect imperfections
You're my end and my beginning
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up then you're down and then between
(Oh baby)
(This is ours baby, yeah)
(Be more straight forward)
Said all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
'Cause baby you're worth it
[Clean:] 'Cause you might look around to find your dreams come true, with me
'Cause I know that's a good place to start
(Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me)
So we should party all night
So hot and heavy
'Til dawn
I got you spinning
Like a disco ball
We're living the life
Like thunder gonna shake the ground
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the fire
Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
Ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar
But I know you can take it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long (all night long)
Until tonight I only dreamed about you
Baby, you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time, one more time
Jack in her cherry Coke town
We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby
Born in the USA
New York to LA
Put me on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Makin' out on living room couches
Blowin' that smoke on a Saturday night
Monday afternoon at practice
We were Jesus save me, blue Jean baby
Making out on living room couches
Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
In the lights
Till the party and music and the truth collide
Spin me round and let 'em buy a couple more
Cause tonight is all about
Dancing with my girls to the DJ
I'm coming in hot
Spinning you round and around in circles
Ooh,
That smile and that midnight laugh she’s giving you now
[Verse 1]
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address,
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room,
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash.
Let me be your ruler (ruler),
[Verse 2]
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
Ooh ooh oh
And I'm in love with being queen.
Life is great without a care
Wait 'til you're announced
(Send the call out) [15x]
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
Living in ruins of a palace within my dreams
All week long it's a farming town
And then it's on, come on, girl, kick it on back
Baby, watch your step now
Better have your boots on
And kick the dust up
Got me a jar full of clear
If you really wanna see the beautiful people
Y'all be glad you did
Kick the dust up (kick the dust up)
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long.
The next Friday night
You should have seen her smile
And put on my best suit
Got in my car and raced like a jet
All the way to you
Can I have your daughter for the rest of my life?
And we'll be a family
Standing at that altar
You know she's in love with me
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
(Eeh ooh, eeh ooh, eeh ooh, eeh ooh) [4x]
Standing strong as the waves roll over
When the nights are long
(Eeh ooh, eeh ooh, eeh ooh, eeh ooh) [2x]
Baby, I'm preying on you tonight
Baby, I'm
Yeah, you can start over, you can run free
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up
Yeah, you can start over you can run free
The beast inside-side-side-side
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That beast inside-side-side-side
I’m searching for a song tonight
We drew a map to a better place
Following, following, following to you
Following, following, following
Yeah yeah yeah
I see the magazine workin' that Photoshop
If you got beauty, beauty, just raise 'em up
(Shoo wop wop, sha-ooh wop wop)
Here's a few things
I deserve it, babe
I'll be the perfect wife
You got that 9 to 5
But, baby, so do I
Sing along with me
Tell me I'm beautiful each and every night
My one and only all my life (hey, baby)
Make time for me
I'll be sleeping on the left side of the bed (hey)
Open doors for me and you might get some kisses
Buy-buy me a ring (babe)
If you wanna get that special loving
Future husband, better love me right
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Now that I've become who I really am
This is the part when I break free
Like a deadly fever, yeah, babe
On the highway to hell, yeah
No more, baby, ooh
Oh, baby
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
(Ah, my my, what elation)
(Oh, my my, what a sensation)
(Oh, my my, what elation)
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'
Good, good, good, good vibrations
Na na na na na, na na na
When you worry you make it double
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
(Be happy)
Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh
(Don't worry, be happy)
(Be Happy)
When you worry call me, I make you happy
And that will bring everybody down
Don't worry, be happy now
Like good little children
Don't worry, be happy, be happy now
(Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it, be happy)
The kid is back, is back on track
And come on, come on back, that's my dog
It was a park of the trailer park
And the boys with the brown, skinny legs
He's coming out on top
Everybody loves the underdog
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, that's my dog
That's my, that's my dog
I'll be lounging on the couch,
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X
And she's gonna scream out: 'This is Great' (Oh my God, this is great!)
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
But now you're in my way
Hot night, wind was blowin'
At you baby,
And all the other boys,
I beg, and borrow and steal
Before you came into my life
Come on baby
Baby, baby twist
Ooh yeah, just like this
Till we tear the house down
Yeah, baby twist
Oooh yeah, just like this
Ee-yah
('Round and 'round and 'round and 'round)
Yeah, you should see my little sis
Yeah, rock on now
('Round and 'round and 'round)
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
Ooh!
Ooh! Guitar!
Tell me that you love me more
Sleepless long nights
Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
For the teenage boys
Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
Our time is short.
And I will nibble your ear
[Live On Earth Single Video version doesn't have this ending contrary to the album version]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
I've always loved you and made you happy
With a pink hotel, a boutique
And a swinging hot SPOT
And put them in a tree museum
A dollar and a half just to see 'em
Put away that DDT now
Michelle Pfeiffer
Straight masterpieces
And my band 'bout that money
Girls hit your hallelujah (ooh)
Saturday night and we in the spot
Wait a minute
Julio, Get the stretch!
Ride to Harlem, Hollywood, Jackson, Mississippi
Smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy
Well it's Saturday night and we in the spot
Making momma so proud
The water is warm
A baby is born
1 2
Life sounds like
I’m alive [x6]
You'll be Bonnie, I’ll be your Clyde
Fireworks, we will ignite
Like Ice-T and Coco
Hey soul sister, I’ll be your mister
(Bring it back one more time)
Life sounds like, like, like…
(1, 2, 3)
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
(Aye, aye, ayeehey...)
With my guitar on the beach there with all my friends
The sun so hot and the waves in motion and everything smells like suntan lotion, the ocean, and the girls so sweet
And now say
That's the sound of sunshine coming down
(Aye, aye aye, Ha, aye aye)
Today is gonna be the day
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day
Flashing lights spin around in circles till we close our eyes
Tomorrow never knows so let's live for tonight
Oh for tonight
Hands up screamin' baby just enjoy the ride [Chorus]
Hey! I found a happy place forever happy days i'm singin' i'm singin ooh ooh ooh
I found a happy place it's written on my face we're singin' we're singin' ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh (x2) we're singin' we're singin' ooh ooh ooh [Verse 2]

I found a happy place (ooh ooh ooh) we're singin' we're singin'
Days (ooh ooh ooh)
Now it's coming back
I can see you
Through the curtains of the waterfall.
Can you feel my love?
At the curtains of the waterfall.
But I've found my friend,
And you've come around,
Can you feel (Say Geronimo! [x4]) my love?
Can you feel (make this leap [x4]) my love? Make this leap.
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high
Well, life is (too short), so love the one you got
It's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you'll finally get what you deserve
Love's what I got
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me
Look ahead, look behind
Back to you
Time after time, I follow signs
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Maybe we found love right where we are
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
Maybe it's all part of a plan
That, baby, now
Maybe we found love right where we are (oh, oh)
So, baby, now
But maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are
You're the light, you're the night
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (yeah)
I'll let you set the pace
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (oh)

Cherry lips, crystal skies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Be that girl for a month
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
She said, "Shut up and dance with me!"
She said, "Ooh-ooh-hoo,
Oh, we were bound to get together,
Bound to get together.
My discothèque, Juliet teenage dream.
I knew we were bound to be together,
Bound to be together

Boy, I adore you, I adore you
I feel like I'm standing with an army
Of men armed with weapons, hey, oh
I love lying next to you
In holy matrimony
Know I love you more (I love you more)
We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
And now, we're ashes on the ground
Ooh girl you're shining
Like a 5th avenue diamond
Ooh pretty baby
When I just wanna make you smile?
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye
Baby you,
Four dozen roses
All the way to serenade you
Doing it Sinatra style
Like a gentleman bringin' glamour back
Keep it reel to reel in the way I feel
It's love on rewind,
From the silver screen
[Malcolm:]
Hippies, Queen of the discotheque
A 70s dream and an 80s best
Touch the ground, and it feels like
I can see the sands on the horizon
Wave after wave, wave after wave
Easy to love me, love me
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
For you here and now
'Cause you love to taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun
Now that bang bang bang,
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
Cold to the touch but she's warm as a devil
You got me in chains for your love
You got me in chains (oh babe)
You got me in chains (oh baby)
But that's just how I feel (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh)
That's just how I feel (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh)
Trying to reach the things that I can't see (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh)
My prediction: Imma be on top of the world
(oh, yeah, yeah, yeah oh)
(oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But that's just how I feel, (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ooh)
[Harry:]
I've got fire for a heart
[Louis:]
[Liam:]
All my life
[Niall:]
I got fire for a heart
The shell of a man who could never be his best (be his best)
[Zayn:]
Going out tonight
Moon is breaking through her hair
We're only getting older, baby
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Chasing it tonight,
Moon is lighting up her skin
With nothing in between
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen (the story of, the story of)
I spend her love
I know that in the morning now I see us in the light upon a hill
I drive all night 
And time is frozen
Dreaming about the things that we could be
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars
I see this life like a swinging vine,
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be-we'll be counting stars
Ye-e-yeah
I feel her love
Sing in the river the lessons I learned
I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun,
I'll be the bright, in black that's makin' you run.
'Cause we'll work it out, yeah, we'll work it out.
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out.
'Cause I worked it out, yeah, I worked it out.
(Ooh) I'll be running, (Ooh) I'll be running,
Got an angel on my shoulder, and Mestopheles.
'Til the love runs out, 'til the love runs out, yeah.
For gold, for rust,
'Cause we'll work it out, yes, we'll work it out.
'Til the love runs out.
Baby, now you're one of us
Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
On the ocean
But I can make an explosion
Starting right now I'll be strong
But there's a fire burning in my bones
This is my fight song (Hey!)
Take back my life song (Hey!)
Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong)
All I need's a little love in my life
I need a little loving tonight
Shot gun, aimed at my heart, you got one
I'm a bring the good time home to you
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shaking the floor, rattling the roof (roof's on fire)
Whatever you got on, baby, stay in it
They roll the sidewalks in this town
When midnight rolls around
High on your loving's got me buzzin' like a streetlight
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We can leave the night on
Now all the stars are turnin' blue
Just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for
Now all the lights are flashin' gold
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon
[Regular version:] We'll be rolling down the windows, (I bet you we're) catchin' our second wind
[Video version:] We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
[Regular version:] Baby, we ain't gotta go home, we can leave the night on
[Video version:] We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
[Video version ending:]
Buzzin' like a streetlight
We can leave 'em on tonight
You probably smile like that all the time
And I know it starts with "Hello"
You and me, we made a vow
For months on end I've had my doubts
I have loved you for many years
[Chorus x2:]
That one day I will be
Right next to you
The moon and the stars
Next to you, you
[This verse is only in the album version:]
Next to you
But, darling, stay with me
You can be amazing
And done some disappearing,
See you be brave
I just wanna see you (yeah)
I just wanna see you (oh ooh)
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
This is a modern fairytale
Breathless moments
Got a feeling that I'm going under
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
I'm left seeing red on my own
[x3:]
Needle and the thread,
(And now that)
I'm the one "for a good time call"
I feel the love, feel the love
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 drink
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier
On for tonight
'Cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart
I'm doing everything I can
You say sorry just for show (hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey)
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
I go on too many dates [chuckle]
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmmm)
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you've got to),
Midnight,
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
I can see the end as it begins
Standing in a nice dress,
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Nothing lasts forever but this is getting good now
Bed, stay in bed
Day drunk into the night
Yeah, summer lovin' and fights
You got a perfect one
[Clean:] We love for life
On and on and on
Love, give me love
Bodies!
Our baby making bodies we just use for fun
(Let's go)
On and on
(Oohhh)
Put your hands in the air, the air
Ooh, na-na
I'm 'bout to spend all this cash
Ooh, na-na-na
[Clean version:] Put your hands in the air if you're loving tonight
[Clean version:] Keep your hands in the air if you're spending the night
Ooh, na-na now, na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Best time of your life, yeah, oh yeah
I'm feeling lucky tonight
When we leave this party, you gon' love me tonight
You feeling lucky tonight (tonight girl)
[Clean version:] Keep your hands in the air if you're spending tonight
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, baby
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, stay here
I love you when you're singing that song and
Run away-ay with me
Two kids, you and me
Living like we're renegades
Long live the pioneers
All hail the new kids
It's our time to make a move
It's our time to make amends
It's our time to break the rules
[Calum:]
