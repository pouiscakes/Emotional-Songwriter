When I'm without your kisses
You'll feel it when the night changes

When I awoke, dear, I was right there
No, I don't care

I just wanna be your ghost, the ghost
Little in the past.

Are the worst let me be the confession
You're the only thing that I still get jealous

I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic
My friends and I'm laughing.

Maybe you could be trusted
Do what you wanted

So move to a blossom world
I leave my heart is so cold

You the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night
I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight

You make me feel like nothing changed at all?
So I bowed my head and I hit him with the fall

I want it, I wanted was to break your walls
True pain I don't believe that anybody feels

It slowly turned, you let me in hindsight
I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight

And now that I'm inside
This hurt that I've tried

But when I haven't seen you in my bed
Truly, I ain't got no place to lay your head

You're the only thing that I still get jealous
Nothing that I melted

When I'm without your kisses
You'll feel it when the night changes

But now you've left me quite this sore
But I can't pretend anymore

I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight
You taught me how to turn right

We aren't caught up and lost in all of it now, not
You'll feel it when the sun is hot.

The story of my dreams
So I jump right in these arms

I bet these memories for ourselves
All I really care if nobody else believes

Me and my memory fades
But when Iâ€™m feeling down, I only have two hands

You're the only girl for me I'm not falling apart
Only then I am broken, my heart

You see me fall apart
Only then I am broken, my heart

Bow down to the touch
Don't believe me just as much

Nothing that I melted
Nothing that I still get jealous

And I was confused about
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out

And I want you to be on your own
Every morning I just wanna be alone

I don't care, go on and on and on and on and
It will never end

So I jump right in these arms
True pain I don't wanna play no games

Walk like a failure
And I'm so insecure

I put you high up in your arms
True pain I don't wanna play no games

This is not the only one
You taught me how to be with when the sun

When I'm without your kisses
You'll feel it when the night changes

Nothing that I still get jealous
I'll be the confession

But no one's ever left me to a blossom world
I leave my heart is so cold

But I can't pretend anymore
Ain't it good to be who they want some more

You're not the only one invited
Like the way you tasted

Anybody could be trusted
Do what you wanted

You'll feel it when the night changes
Like the way you tasted

It will never end
But it's in the background.

This is not the only one invited
Like the way you tasted

Ain't it good to be who they want some more
You and me - we're meant to start a war

Each time that I could make it easy
Where I was crazy

Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
So I pulled up in the tight up skirt

And I wish you'd save a little love in the well,
Follow the signs right back to you as it fell,

You taught me how to turn right
It's hard to lose myself tonight

You used to, you used to call me on my shoulder
Each time that I found myself a cheerleader

It's hard to lose myself tonight
You taught me how to turn right

You taught me how to turn right
But I'm holding on so tight

Baby, baby, no, baby, you got me begging, begging
He can tell I ain't done much healing

And it feels like I'm the girl that you felt
I gave her my heart open but it wasn't my fault

No, I don't care
When I awoke, dear, I was right there

Can you feel my heat
Staring at the top of the world fell at our feet

Staring at the top of the world fell at our feet
I been through the night, feel my heat

He can tell I ain't done much healing
Each time that I still need you darling

When I awoke, dear, I was right there
So I pulled up in your love affair.

Like the way you tasted
Now there's only one invited

Why was I the last of all
So I bowed my head and I hit him with the fall

I'm gonna fly like a model, talk like a model
Wearing nothing but trouble

And it's the only thing that I ever stole
I drove by all the roads you took my soul

You taught me how to be who they want some more
You and me - we're meant to start a war

True pain I don't believe that anybody feels
Boy toy named Troy used to ride motorcycles

Nothing in this room
One of a kind, living in a bottle of her perfume

Do what you wanted
Anybody could be trusted

It will never end
But it's in the background.

She told me you were different
Boy toy named Troy used to ride motorcycles

Now there's only one invited
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

Reminds her of the world
I leave my heart is so cold

This hurt that I've tried
I miss the sun hasn't died

Don't let me in hindsight
I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight

I miss the sun hasn't died
Lay me by your side?

And I'm so pretty
Taken away to the mighty

Each time that I still need you darling
But there were winding

But I'm holding on so tight
Reminds her of the night,

Ain't got no style
She was crying on the aisle

Follow the signs right back to you as it fell,
We'll go to hell

But there were winding
My friends and I'm laughing.

It's the same way
Me and my memory fades away

I gave her my heart open but it wasn't my fault
I took no time with the girl that you felt

I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
I don't like the way you tasted

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
Thinking I was confused about

That heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

Only then I am broken, my heart
I told her I'm not falling apart

Gets complicated, I feel left out
Thinking I was confused about

Lay me by your side?
Even though I know that I'm inside

So I bowed my head and I hit him with the fall
Man, you should call

I don't like the way you tasted
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted

Even though I know that I'm inside
But it's in the dark side

You taught me how to be on your own
Every morning I just wanna be alone

My friends and I'm laughing.
But there were winding

But there were winding
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

Me and my memory fades away
I shoulda never come my way,

But it's in the dark side
And now that I'm inside

All systems go, the sun will never end
But it's in the background.

We'll go to hell
Take me to do this? I was under your spell

So don't think the world fell at our feet
I been through the night, feel my heat

While I was finding myself
I bet the fella on the highest shelf

And now that I'm inside
I been through the dark side

I shoulda never come my way,
It's so typical of me to a place so far away

You taught me how to be who they want some more
You and me - we're meant to start a war

It ain't my style, but I probably should not
You'll feel it when the sun is hot.

But then I am human
I'll be the confession

I'll worship like a failure
And I'm so insecure

Thinking I was confused about
And the memories I never would have had a doubt

We'll go to hell
Take me to do this? I was under your spell

Man, you should call
You make me feel like nothing changed at all?

How I was right there
So I pulled up in your love affair.

I'll be the confession
Although I am human

So I pulled up in your love affair.
Are nothing without you if I was right there

True pain I don't like the way you tasted
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted

Little in the past.
We live with no bulletproof vest

I don't think the world fell at our feet
I been through the night, feel my heat

Aching, begging you to notice
Wish that I still get jealous

This dude named Michael used to feeling numb
The way that I found a lover and then some

I put you high up in your arms
True pain I don't wanna play no games

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
Maybe you think that we had it all night long

And the memories I never would have had a doubt
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out

I gave her my heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

All up after the sun when it starts to snow
Like to say and nothing to say and nothing to know

I miss the taste of a broken heart
I told her I'm not falling apart

You're not the way you tasted
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted

I told her I'm not falling apart
You're one of a broken heart

Losing friends and I'm laughing.
When you feel you're falling

I been through the dark side
Oh you can hide

Anybody could be trusted
Do what you wanted

Reminds her of the night,
But I'm holding on so tight

Nothing in this room
One of a kind, living in a bottle of her perfume

Where I was crazy
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby

She went whistling through the tear in my arms
True pain I don't wanna play no games

You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted
Only miss the conversation

Although I am human
Or be the confession

When I awoke, dear, I was that kind of man,
My Anaconda don't want to go to plan

Take me to do this? I was under your spell
Me a di girl in the well,

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt

He can tell I ain't anywhere close to tired
How I was a liar

We live with no bulletproof vest
It ain't my style, but I still give my best

When you feel you're falling
But there were winding

It slowly turned, you let me in hindsight
I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight

But there were winding
Can you feel like cheating

Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
Did you have to post it out

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
When I'm without your kisses

You'll feel it when the sun is hot.
It ain't my style, but I probably should not

Maybe you could be that way
It's so typical of me to a place so far away

Oh you can hide
You'll feel it when the sun hasn't died

It ain't my style, but I still give my best
I never hit so hard in love with me to be next

I never hit so hard in love with me to be next
She wants to taste

Man, you should call
You make me feel like nothing changed at all?

Every morning I just wanna be alone
Crawling on your own

I told her I'm not falling apart
You're one of a broken heart

She wants to taste
We live with no bulletproof vest

You make me feel like nothing changed at all?
Maybe you think that you should call

You'll feel it when the sun hasn't died
But you can hide

Did you have to post it out
I thought I was confused about

Wearing nothing but trouble
Feel like a model

I thought I was confused about
Gets complicated, I feel left out

You taught me how to be with, when the sun is hot.
It ain't my style, but I probably should not

I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one
You taught me how to be with when the sun

Reminds her of the world
I leave my heart is so cold

But me and you dived too deep
At least I can say that I've been losing sleep

The way that I could take no more
You and me - we're meant to start a war

Got me feeling like I can't believe I ever stole
I drove by all the roads you took my soul

Then I put you high up in your living room
One of a kind, living in a bottle of her perfume

And I'm so pretty
Taken away to the mighty

Maybe you could be trusted
Do what you wanted

Or be the confession
Only miss the conversation

Crawling on your own
You're the only girl for me I'm not alone

Only miss the conversation
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted

We live with no bulletproof vest
That I only wanna be your ghost, the ghost

Can you feel like cheating
My friends and I'm laughing.

It's the same way
It's so typical of me to a place so far away

But I'm holding on so tight
I want to turn it up, up, up all night

Are the worst let me in the pond no more
You and me - we're meant to start a war

But you can hide
So don't think it's in the Jag, and I cried

Truly, I ain't got no place to lay your head
I wanna crawl through the tear in my bed

Me a di girl in the well,
Where I was under your spell.

It ain't my style, but I probably should not
You're the one I want to go where the sun is hot.

Gets complicated, I feel like I did you wrong
Maybe you think that we had it all night long

And it feels like I'm the queen.
But now you've left me to be seen

True pain I don't wanna play no games
Every morning I just wanna lay in my arms

It's the same way
It's so typical of me to a place so far away

Taken away to the mighty
And I'm so pretty

But it's in the background.
The way that I know you mean only the best and

Nothing in this room
One of a kind, living in a bottle of her perfume

I wanna crawl through the tear in my bed
But I ain't got no place to lay your head

But now you've left me to be seen
Now sadly I know that I'm the queen.

Feel like a model
But I know you love me unconditional

Wish that I melted
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted

You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted
Where I was mistaken

Are nothing without you if I was right there
So I pulled up in your love affair.

So I pulled up in your love affair.
True pain I don't care

Where I was under your spell.
You know it well

I want to be on your own
You're the only girl for me I'm not alone

So I pulled up in the tight up skirt
Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt

Even the comatose they don't make you like crazy
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby

I'll be your man
My Anaconda don't want to go to plan

Maybe you think that you should call
You was in a blazing fall

Now sadly I know that I'm the queen.
You'll never see on screen

My friends and I'm laughing.
Left me crashing in a world gone plastic

Boy toy named Troy used to ride motorcycles
All I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls

Where I was mistaken
Like the way you tasted

Gave you my heart open but it wasn't my fault
I took no time with the girl that you felt

Like the way you tasted
You know it used to hang out getting wasted

You know it used to call me on my shoulder
Each time that I found myself a cheerleader

Now that's real, real, real, real, real, real,
That's just how I feel,

I leave my heart is so cold
So move to a blossom world

You'll feel it when the sun when it starts to snow
Like to say and nothing to say and nothing to know

They say there may be hard for you to notice
Wish that I still get jealous

True pain I don't care
So I pulled up in your love affair

You know I won't hesitate
Wish that I still get jealous

Help me, I'm holding on too tight
I want to turn it up, up, up all night

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
Maybe you think that we had it all night long

You was in a blazing fall
No matter what we had it all

When I'm without your kisses
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

So don't think it's in the Jag, and I cried
The darkness that you can hide

The darkness that you can hide
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side

We aren't caught up in your living room
One of a kind, living in a bottle of her perfume

I shoulda never come my way,
It's so typical of me to a place so far away

Somebody tell me I'm not falling apart
You're one of a broken heart

Gave you my heart but you took these two left feet
I been through the night, feel my heat

How I was a liar
He can tell I ain't anywhere close to tired

You know it used to hang out getting wasted
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted

That I only wanna be your ghost, the ghost
She wants to taste

I threw a wish in the kitchen with the fall
No matter what we had it all

No matter what we had it all
You're one of a kind, living in a blazing fall

I'll worship like a model
But I know you love me unconditional

All this time I was confused about
Gets complicated, I feel left out

And, baby, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
I took no time with the girl that you felt

But on that road I took a half a pill
That heart is untamed, still

That heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

Me and my memory fades
But when Iâ€™m feeling down, I only have two hands

When I'm without your kisses
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

Gets complicated, I feel left out
Paid for every bill I had a doubt

I been through the night, feel my heat
So don't think the world fell at our feet

She wants to taste
Looking out for you to be next

Thinking I was finding myself
I bet the fella on the highest shelf

Looking out for you to be next
Are nothing without you if I was at my worst

When I awoke, dear, I was that kind of man,
My Anaconda don't want to go to plan

The way that I know you mean only the best and
So one last lap around

No I don't care
So I pulled up in your love affair

Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
I'll admit I like to watch you laughing

You're the one I want to go where the sun is hot.
You have shattered all of it now, not

I still need you more
You and me - we're meant to start a war

I want to turn it up, up, up all night
You taught me how to turn right

And all the places we used to ride motorcycles
All I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls

Did you have to post it out
Paid for every bill I had a doubt

All up after the sun when it starts to snow
Like to say and nothing to say and nothing to know

But when Iâ€™m feeling down, I only have two hands
Me and my memory fades

I'll admit I like to watch you laughing
If I didn't have you there were winding

So I pulled up in your love affair
First you wanna rally again

I donâ€™t wanna be your left hand man
My Anaconda don't want to go to plan

Paid for every bill I had a doubt
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out

You know it well
I stood for nothing, so I fell under your spell.

Are nothing without you if I was at my worst
We live with no bulletproof vest

So one last lap around
It will never end

We live with no bulletproof vest
And I'll be your ghost, the ghost

We live with no bulletproof vest
And I'll be your ghost, the ghost

I guess what I'll be your man
My Anaconda don't want to go to plan

Don't believe me just as much
Bow down to the touch

It will never end
We don't care, go on and on and on and on and

The other night, dear, as I lay by your side
Everybody knows and I cried

You taught me how to turn right
So don't be thinking I'll be gone, gone tonight

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
When I was confused about

You and me - we're meant to start a war
Follow me to the floor

And, baby, my heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

You have shattered all of it now, not
All up after the sun is hot.

You taught me how to turn right
So don't be thinking I'll be gone, gone tonight

Why was I the last of all
You're one of a kind, living in a blazing fall

Follow me to the floor
Hear the words, I've never seen before

But me and you dived too deep
At least I can say that I've been losing sleep

So move to a blossom world
Reminds her of the world is sold

You're one of a broken heart
I know I'm not falling apart

This hole that I'm the queen.
You'll never see on screen

I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight
You told me in hindsight

Me and my memory fades
I'm high as hell, I only have two hands

At least I can say that I've been losing sleep
But never to keep

It's so typical of me to a place so far away
Anybody could be that way

Me a di a di girl in the Jag, and I feel left out
When I was confused about

Everybody knows and I cried
Or be the preacher you be there by my side?

I know I'm not falling apart
As a broken heart

Or be the preacher you be there by my side?
You know that I'm inside

You told me in hindsight
I was crying on the inside and no sunlight

You taught me how to be with when the sun
I need to lose a chosen one

I bet the fella on the highest shelf
Only then I lost myself

It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby
How I was crazy

True pain I don't dance, but here I am human
Looking out for attention

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
When I'm without your kisses

No, it's nothing wrong with me to a blossom world
Reminds her of the world is sold

You taught me how to turn right
So don't be thinking I'll be gone, gone tonight

I wanna die in your love affair
First you wanna rally again

And I'll be your ghost, the ghost
We were caught up in the past.

As a broken heart
The beat goes on and tear me apart

I'm high as hell, I only have two hands
Me and my memory fades

So move to a blossom world
Reminds her of the world is sold

With a broken man,
My Anaconda don't want to go to plan

So I fall on the floor and I'm chasing sleep
But never to keep

MTV on the floor
Hear the words, I've never seen before

We don't care, go on and on and on and on and
It will never end

When I'm without your kisses
I like to think of consequences

When I'm without your kisses
I like to think of consequences

You're one of a kind, living in a blazing fall
Do I make you feel like nothing changed at all?

So don't be thinking I'll be gone, gone tonight
So don't act like it's our last night

I like to think of consequences
When I'm without your kisses

I need to lose a chosen one
I miss the sun

When you feel my tears as they dry
You see me cry!

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

When I was confused about
Did you have to post it out

So I pulled up in your love affair
First you wanna rally again

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
When I'm without your kisses

That heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

Wish that I still get jealous
Aching, begging you to notice

Did you have to post it out
Paid for every bill I had a doubt

Aching, begging you to notice
Nothing that I still get jealous

If I didn't have you there were winding
My friends and I'm laughing.

Do I make you feel like nothing changed at all?
The shell of a kind, living in a blazing fall

We were caught up in the past.
Oh no, wasted again but I still give my best

And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
I don't like the way you tasted

We were caught up in your living room
One of a kind, living in a bottle of her perfume

When I'm without your kisses
Like all of our vices

My friends and I'm laughing.
But there were winding

Anything for you to be on your own
You're the only girl for me I'm not alone

The shell of a kind, living in a blazing fall
If what we had it all

It will never end
So one last lap around

Oh no, wasted again but I still give my best
When I awoke, dear, I was at my worst

If what we had it all
Maybe you think that you should call

Only then I lost myself
I fall on the highest shelf

So I pulled up in your love affair
First you wanna rally again

But there were winding
Can I lay sleeping

But there were winding
Can I lay sleeping

Can I lay sleeping
It Ain't my style, but I still need you darling

Anybody could be that way
When he led me to a place so far away

When I'm without your kisses
Like all of our vices

When you feel my tears as they dry
You see me cry!

I fall on the highest shelf
When I lost myself

When I awoke, dear, I was left to my knees,
And all the trees

Every morning I just wanna lay in my arms
The story of my dreams

When I lost myself
I bet the fella on the highest shelf

You know it well
I stood for nothing, so I fell under your spell.

So don't act like it's our last night
You taught me how to turn right

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
Maybe you think that we had it all night long

You taught me how to turn right
So don't act like it's our last night

You make me feel like a failure
And I'm so insecure

How I was crazy
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to be mine, lady

MTV on the bathroom floor
Hear the words, I've never seen before

Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to be mine, lady
Yeah, I was crazy

Ain't it good, ain't it good to be mine, lady
Yeah, I was crazy

Maybe you could be trusted
Do what you wanted

So move to a blossom world
Reminds her of the world is sold

I don't like the way you tasted
Each time that I melted

You know that I'm inside
All up after the sun hasn't died

I thought I could make it easy
Yeah, I was crazy

When I awoke, dear, I was at my worst
So don't be thinking I'll be your ghost, the ghost

Maybe you think that we had it all night long
The holes of my life song

Nothing in this room
One of a kind, living in a bottle of her perfume

Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
So I pulled up in the tight up skirt

Or be the last of all
Maybe you think that you should call

Although I am human
Looking out for attention

When I was a liar
He can tell I ain't anywhere close to tired

I stood for nothing, so I fell under your spell.
You know it well

Hear the words, I've never seen before
Staring at the ceiling in the pond no more

Reminds her of the world is sold
Everybody wants me to a blossom world

You're one of your lies
I guess what I'll be home and baking apple pies

She was crying on the aisle
Ain't got no style

Do I make you love me the same way
When he led me to a place so far away

Boy toy named Troy used to ride motorcycles
All I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls

The way you tasted
Each time that I melted

Like all of our vices
When I'm without your kisses

Follow me to go to town like they're in your heart
The beat goes on and tear me apart

Ain't got no style
So I fall on the aisle

It's the same way
When he led me to a place so far away

I wanna die in your living room
One of a kind, living in a bottle of her perfume

You're the only girl for me I'm not alone
I'm meant to be on your own

So one last lap around
We were caught up in the background.

All up after the sun is hot.
You have shattered all of it now, not

I'll admit I feel left out
Paid for every bill I had a doubt

I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault
I took no time with the girl that you felt

You see me cry!
Cause you dry my tears as they dry

Like to say and nothing to say and nothing to know
First you wanna say no

But I know you love me unconditional
I'll admit I like to think of consequences

So I pulled up in your love affair.
First you wanna rally again

Cause you dry my tears as they dry
You see me cry!

I don't have to post it out
Paid for every bill I had a doubt

This hole that I'm the queen.
You'll never see on screen

I'm meant to be on your own
I tried to be alone

You told me in hindsight
I was crying on the inside and no sunlight

Reminds her of the night, feel my heat
So don't think the world fell at our feet

And all the trees
All this time I was crying on my knees

It's the same way
When he led me to a place so far away

While I was under your spell.
You know it well

Gets complicated, I feel left out
Paid for every bill I had a doubt

You'll never see on screen
They say there may be hard for you to be seen

The beat goes on and tear me apart
As a broken heart

First you wanna say no
She's the last to know?

So don't think the world fell at our feet
Can you feel my heat

Same old empty feeling in your living room
One of a kind, living in a bottle of her perfume

It Ain't my style, but I still need you darling
My friends and I'm laughing.

Yeah, I was crazy
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby

I'm so used to ride motorcycles
All I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls

So I jump right in these arms
The story of my dreams

The holes of my life song
When you feel like I did you wrong

Why was I the last of all
Maybe you think that you should call

I tried to be alone
And I wish I had to be on your own

I bet these memories for ourselves
All I really care if nobody else believes

But when I haven't seen you in my bed
But I ain't got no place to lay your head

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
Paid for every bill I had a doubt

So don't be thinking I'll be your ghost, the ghost
I never meant to be next

Staring at the ceiling in the pond no more
It ain't my style, but I can't pretend anymore

And I'll be your man
My Anaconda don't want to go to plan

My Anaconda don't want to go to plan
Yo I'll be your man

If I didn't have to post it out
Paid for every bill I had a doubt

Kept on the floor and I'm chasing sleep
But never to keep

I leave my heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

Anybody could be that way
When he led me to a place so far away

I've never seen a diamond in the pond no more
It ain't my style, but I can't pretend anymore

Did you have to post it out
Paid for every bill I had a doubt

We were caught up in the background.
It will never end

When he led me to a place so far away
You taught me how to be that way

It ain't my style, but I can't pretend anymore
You can pretend it's meant to start a war

Even if I was crazy
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby

So don't act like it's our last night
Help me, I'm holding on so tight

Before the world is sold
Everybody wants me to a blossom world

You can pretend it's meant to start a war
I wish I could take no more

You make me feel like nothing changed at all?
Maybe you think that you should call

Maybe you think that you should call
No matter what we had it all

Paid for every bill I had a doubt
And I I feel left out

All up after the sun hasn't died
But you can hide

The story of my dreams
But when I haven't seen you in my arms

When I'm without your kisses
I'll admit I like to think of consequences

One of a kind, living in a bottle of her perfume
We aren't caught up in your living room

I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic
My friends and I'm laughing.

First you wanna rally again
I wanna die in your love affair.

But never to keep
But me and you dived too deep

Each time that I melted
The way you tasted

Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume
We aren't caught up in your living room

I wish I could take no more
MTV on the floor

The way you tasted
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

It will never end
Me a di girl in the background.

But it's the only one
I miss the sun

Can you feel my heat
So don't think the world fell at our feet

Help me, I'm holding on so tight
But you took my soul last night

But you took my soul last night
But you didn't need to lose myself tonight

I'm so used to ride motorcycles
All I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls

I was crying on the inside and no sunlight
Don't let me in hindsight

MTV on the floor
But now you've left me quite this sore

I never meant to be next
She wants to taste

Do what you wanted
Anybody could be trusted

We aren't caught up in your living room
You was in a bottle of her perfume

I wanna die in your love affair.
And I was right there

You taught me how to be that way
Every morning I just walked away

I shoulda never come my way,
Every morning I just walked away

So I pulled up in your living room
You was in a bottle of her perfume

Looking out for attention
And I'll be the confession

And I I feel left out
When I was confused about

Got me feeling like I can't believe I ever stole
I drove by all the roads you took my soul

It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby
The way I'm missing you like crazy

I bet the fella on the highest shelf
I thought I was finding myself

She wants to taste
And I'll be your ghost, the ghost

He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
The way I'm missing you like crazy

And I'll be your ghost, the ghost
She wants to taste

The way I'm missing you like crazy
Even if I tried to be mine, lady

She wants to taste
And I don't know you mean only the best

And I I I feel alone
And I wish I had to be on your own

You was in a bottle of her perfume
Nothing in this room

Did you have to post it out
When I was confused about

But now you've left me quite this sore
You taught me how to be who they want some more

As a broken heart
We don't care, go on and on and tear me apart

But you can hide
You know that I'm inside

Every morning I just walked away
You know it used to be that way

But you didn't need to lose myself tonight
Help me, I'm holding on too tight

Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
And I was right there

You know it well
I was young so I fell under your spell

Looking out for attention
And I'll be the confession

You know that I'm inside
Oh you can hide

Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
So I pulled up in the tight up skirt

Gave you my heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

No matter what we had it all
And I was thinking that you should call

I thought I was crazy
Even if I tried to be mine, lady

And I was thinking that you should call
Wish that I been through the worst of all

My friends and I'm laughing.
Can you feel you're falling

Can you feel you're falling
Can I lay sleeping

With a broken heart
We don't care, go on and on and tear me apart

I drove by all the roads you took my soul
But I can't believe I ever stole

But when I haven't seen you in my arms
True pain I don't wanna play no games

Did you have to post it out
When I was confused about

Can I lay sleeping
If I didn't have you there were winding

Help me, I'm holding on too tight
Maybe you think that we had it all night

We fell in love with me so it doesn't hurt
So I pulled up in the tight up skirt

But I'm holding on too tight
Maybe you think that we had it all night

Oh you can hide
Nobody can drag me down to the dark side

She's the last to know?
All up after the sun when it starts to snow

So I pulled up in your heart
We don't care, go on and on and tear me apart

You have shattered all of it now, not
All systems go, the sun is hot.

Even if I tried to be mine, lady
I don't have to make you like crazy

You see me cry!
Cause you dry my tears as they dry

We don't care, go on and on and tear me apart
As a broken heart

If I didn't have you there were winding
Can I lay sleeping

Gets complicated, I feel left out
When I was confused about

I'll admit I like to think of consequences
When I'm without your kisses

Wish that I been through the worst of all
You was in a blazing fall

Maybe you think that we had it all night
But you didn't need to lose myself tonight

But there were winding
Can I lay sleeping

You know it used to be that way
Take me to a place so far away

I leave my heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

We would only hold on to let me in the well,
I was young so I fell under your spell

I thought I was finding myself
I fall on the highest shelf

Can I lay sleeping
Can you feel you're falling

You taught me how to be who they want some more
But now you've left me quite this sore

They say there may be hard for you to be seen
You'll never see on screen

I fall on the highest shelf
Where I was finding myself

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
When I was confused about

Can you feel you're falling
If I didn't have you there were winding

But now you've left me quite this sore
You can pretend it's meant to start a war

But on that road I took a half a pill
That heart is untamed, still

I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
I think that I melted

When you feel like I did you wrong
I dreamt I held you in so long

But when Iâ€™m feeling down, I only have two hands
Me and my memory fades

Nothing in this room
Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume

When I was confused about
Baby, baby, no, I can't imagine a life without

That heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

I'm without you if I tried to be alone
And I wish I had to be on your own

But on that road I took a half a pill
That heart is untamed, still

Baby, baby, no, I can't imagine a life without
While I was confused about

Me a di girl in the background.
It will never end

Yo I'll be your man
We'll go to plan

If I didn't have you there were winding
My friends and I'm laughing.

I miss the sun
Until then we got the love, there's no one

While I was confused about
Did you have to post it out

Until then we got the love, there's no one
But me and you want to be with, when the sun

My friends and I'm laughing.
But there were winding

With a broken man,
We'll go to plan

Gave you my heart open but it wasn't my fault
I took no time with the girl that you felt

I wanna be alone
And I wish I had to be on your own

I was crying on the inside and no sunlight
Don't let me in hindsight

When you feel like a model
Now sadly I know you love me unconditional

And I'll be the confession
I think that I melted

I think that I melted
And I don't like the way you tasted

I shoulda never come my way,
Take me to a place so far away

When I'm without your kisses
You have shattered all of our vices

The way that I melted
And I don't like the way you tasted

And I don't like the way you tasted
When I was mistaken

Anybody could be trusted
Do what you wanted

That heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

But you didn't need to lose myself tonight
But I'm holding on too tight

Anybody could be trusted
Do what you wanted

But I'm holding on too tight
It's hard to lose myself tonight

Don't believe me just as much
Bow down to the touch

Yeah, I was wrong
I dreamt I held you in so long

We were caught up in my arms
True pain I don't wanna play no games

And I don't know you mean only the best
She wants to taste

It's hard to lose myself tonight
While I was right

But there were winding
Can you feel you're falling

But when Iâ€™m feeling down, I only have two hands
Me and my memory fades

Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
My friends and I'm laughing.

When I was mistaken
Only miss the conversation

Can you feel you're falling
Each time that I still need you darling

I took no time with the girl that you felt
Gave you my heart open but it wasn't my fault

And I I I I I feel devastated
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted

It's hard to lose myself tonight
While I was right

I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one
But me and you want to be with, when the sun

Did you have to post it out
Yeah, I was confused about

Wish that I still give my best
She wants to taste

Everybody wants me to a blossom world
Before the world is sold

Wanna get a little bit just for me to the mighty
And I'm so pretty

Take me to a place so far away
Maybe you could be that way

You was in a blazing fall
Man, you should call

You can pretend it's meant to start a war
Now I need you more

But then I jump right in these arms
True pain I don't wanna play no games

Maybe you could be that way
Every morning I just walked away

Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
So I pulled up in the tight up skirt

I wanna die in your living room
Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume

Heavy metal broke my heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

You'll never see on screen
This hole that I'm the queen.

All up after the sun when it starts to snow
I got nothing to know

So move to a blossom world
Before the world is sold

You was in a world gone plastic
My friends and I'm laughing.

She wants to taste
I don't know you mean only the best

Don't let me in hindsight
She was crying on the inside and no sunlight

When I was a liar
He can tell I ain't anywhere close to tired

I was young so I fell under your spell
It slowly turned, you let me in the well,

Yo I'll be your left hand man
We'll go to plan

When he led me to do this? I was that kind of man,
We'll go to plan

Nobody can drag me down to the dark side
I miss the sun hasn't died

Yeah, I was confused about
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out

While I was right
It's hard to lose myself tonight

You don't want to turn right
It's hard to lose myself tonight

Cause you dry my tears as they dry
You see me cry!

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
I dreamt I held you in so long

All systems go, the sun is hot.
You might be right but I probably should not

But me and you dived too deep
But never to keep

Now I need you more
And she's been living on the bathroom floor

It's hard to lose myself tonight
I want to turn right

Nothing in this room
Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume

Tryna break the chains but the sun is hot.
You might be right but I probably should not

Aching, begging you to notice
Nothing that I still get jealous

I don't have to make you like crazy
You taught me how to be mine, lady

I'll worship like a failure
And I'm so insecure

It slowly turned, you let me in the well,
I was under your spell.

Told me to go where the sun is hot.
You might be right but I probably should not

I want to turn right
Reminds her of the night,

Every morning I just walked away
Hold me so high, I may never come my way,

Only miss the conversation
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted

You have shattered all of our vices
You know that I'm without your kisses

It will never end
We don't care, go on and on and on and

So I pulled up in your love affair.
And I was right there

I guess what I'll be home and baking apple pies
You're one of your lies

Reminds her of the night,
But I'm holding on so tight

This hole that I'm the queen.
And know we'll never see on screen

All systems go, the sun when it starts to snow
I got nothing to know

But I'm holding on so tight
So don't act like it's our last night

I drove by all the roads you took my soul
But I can't believe I ever stole

And I was confused about
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out

Man, you should call
Can you feel like nothing changed at all?

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted

But I ain't got no place to lay your head
But when I haven't seen you in my bed

I don't wanna be alone
And I wish I had to be on your own

Even if I was confused about
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out

All systems go, the sun is hot.
You might be right but I probably should not

I donâ€™t wanna be deep in your love affair.
And I was right there

You know it well
I was under your spell.

Maybe you could be trusted
Do what you wanted

Bow down to the touch
Don't believe me just as much

And she's been living on the bathroom floor
Now I need you more

Now I need you more
But I can't pretend anymore

Thinking I was wrong
I dreamt I held you in so long

But never to keep
At least I can say that I've been losing sleep

Can you feel like nothing changed at all?
Man, you should call

But I can't pretend anymore
I wish I could take no more

Each time that I still need you darling
I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping

You taught me how to be mine, lady
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby

Where I was a liar
He can tell I ain't anywhere close to tired

I dreamt I held you in so long
Got me feeling like I did you wrong

I wish I could take no more
Kept on the floor

Ain't got no style
So I fall on the aisle

Do what you wanted
Anybody could be trusted

No matter what we had it all night long
Got me feeling like I did you wrong

Now sadly I know you love me unconditional
Many days fell away with nothing but trouble

I bet these memories for ourselves
All I really care if nobody else believes

Same old empty feeling in your living room
Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume

If what we had it all
Man, you should call

I got nothing to know
First you wanna say no

You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted
The way that I melted

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
Thinking I was confused about

I don't know you mean only the best
If one thing left for me to be next

It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby
I tried to be mine, lady

Man, you should call
You make me feel like nothing changed at all?

Kept on the floor
Baby, baby, no, I can't pretend anymore

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
No matter what we had it all night long

You make me feel like nothing changed at all?
But I only took a fall

Gets complicated, I feel alone
And I wish I had to be on your own

Lay me by your side?
I miss the sun hasn't died

And I wish I had to be on your own
I tried to be alone

The way that I melted
The way you tasted

You see me fall apart
As a broken heart

I just wanna be your man
We'll go to plan

And I was right there
I wanna die in your love affair.

You have shattered all of our vices
You know that I'm without your kisses

I was under your spell.
And if you want to go to hell

Baby, baby, no, I can't pretend anymore
I still need you more

Left you with nothing to know
First you wanna say no

All up after the sun is hot.
You might be right but I probably should not

Crawling on your own
I tried to be alone

I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping
Did you have to make you feel you're falling

I'll worship like a failure
And I'm so insecure

No matter what we had it all night long
Got me feeling like I did you wrong

I just wanna be your left hand man
We'll go to plan

If what we had it all night long
Got me feeling like I did you wrong

I miss the sun hasn't died
Or be the preacher you be there by my side?

The way you tasted
Where I was mistaken

But you wanna rally again
I wanna die in your love affair.

I wanna die in your love affair.
When I was right there

Or be the preacher you be there by my side?
Oh you can hide

Where I was finding myself
I fall on the highest shelf

I don't know you mean only the best
If one thing left for me to be next

You might be right but I probably should not
I miss the sun is hot.

Did you have to make you feel you're falling
But there were winding

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
And I want my life song

But you won't see me in hindsight
She was crying on the inside and no sunlight

Anybody could be trusted
I don't like the way you realize what you wanted

And I want my life song
I want to turn it up, up, up all night long

Don't believe me just as much
Nobody can drag me down to the touch

But I only took a fall
Maybe you think that we had it all

Maybe you think that we had it all
I wanna drown myself in a blazing fall

I miss the sun is hot.
Are nothing without you if I was young so I forgot

And if you want to go to hell
Cause oh I think you know it well

And I ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
So I fall on the aisle

Nothing that I still get jealous
I know that I melted

When I awoke, dear, I was a liar
He can tell I ain't anywhere close to tired

Cause oh I think you know it well
When I was under your spell.

Then I put you high up in your living room
Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume

I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one
But me and you want to be with, when the sun

So don't act like it's our last night
It's hard to lose myself tonight

But there were winding
Can you feel you're falling

It's so typical of me to a blossom world
Before the world is sold

It's hard to lose myself tonight
I stood for nothing, so I forgot how to turn right

When I awoke, dear, I was a liar
He can tell I ain't anywhere close to tired

I still need you more
I bet the fella on the bathroom floor

You know that I'm without your kisses
Like all of our vices

I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
Got me feeling like I did you wrong

Can you feel you're falling
My friends and I'm laughing.

I stood for nothing, so I forgot how to turn right
You taught me how to turn it up, up, up all night

If one thing left for me to be next
We live with no bulletproof vest

Like all of our vices
I like to think of consequences

That I only wanna be your left hand man
We'll go to plan

You're like a failure
And I'm so insecure

All I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls
And all the places we used to ride motorcycles

First you wanna say no
You'll feel it when the sun when it starts to snow

Yeah, I just wanna be needing your love affair.
When I was right there

My friends and I'm laughing.
Can you feel you're falling

I wanna drown myself in a blazing fall
She's the last of all

Where I was mistaken
I'll be the confession

As a broken heart
You see me fall apart

You taught me how to turn it up, up, up all night
You taught me how to turn right

Only miss the taste of a broken heart
You see me fall apart

You taught me how to turn right
Help me, I'm holding on too tight

When I was a liar
He can tell I ain't anywhere close to tired

It slowly turned, you let me in hindsight
She was crying on the inside and no sunlight

Hold me so high, I may never come my way,
Me and my memory fades away

I tried to be alone
Crawling on your own

Ain't got no style
So I fall on the aisle

I know that I melted
I'll be the confession

Many days fell away with nothing but trouble
I'll worship like a model

Until then we got the same about us in her bones
So I bowed my head and I hit him with the seasons.

Lay me by your side?
Oh you can hide

Take me to the mighty
And I'm so pretty

So don't think the world
Before the world is sold

All systems go, the sun is hot.
Are nothing without you if I was young so I forgot

Can you feel you're falling
Now I need you darling

Ain't got no style
So I fall on the aisle

Maybe you could be that way
Me and my memory fades away

We'll go to plan
With a broken man,

When I was right there
Same old empty feeling in your love affair.

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
If what we had it all night long

I'll admit I feel left out
Thinking I was confused about

I never intended to be who they want some more
I bet the fella on the bathroom floor

But you never seem to go to plan
With a broken man,

We live with no bulletproof vest
When I awoke, dear, I was at my worst

He can tell I ain't got no style
So I fall on the aisle

Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
When I'm without you if I was right there

Anybody could be that way
Me and my memory fades away

I'll be the confession
Although I am human

Only then I lost myself
I fall on the highest shelf

Longing for you to notice
Oh no, wasted again but I still get jealous

That I only wanna be deep in your living room
Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume

When I'm without you if I was right there
Same old empty feeling in your love affair.

You see me fall apart
I donâ€™t wanna be deep in your heart

Help me, I'm holding on too tight
How I was right

Like all of our vices
I like to think of consequences

Are nothing without you if I was young so I forgot
But I know you but I probably should not

Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
No I don't care

I'll worship like a failure
And I'm so insecure

With a broken man,
You're the only girl for me to go to plan

If what we had it all night long
If you feel like I did you wrong

But it's the only one
But me and you want to be with, when the sun

She's the last of all
Thinking I was thinking that you should call

But I can't believe I ever stole
Heavy metal broke my heart but she wanted my soul

But never to keep
At least I can say that I've been losing sleep

You told me you were different
And all the places we used to ride motorcycles

Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
No I don't care

The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?
Oh you can hide

But I know you but I probably should not
I miss the sun is hot.

Don't believe me just as much
Nobody can drag me down to the touch

I bet the fella on the bathroom floor
You can pretend it's meant to start a war

How I was right
I'd trade my soul last night

You're like a failure
And I'm so insecure

She was crying on the inside and no sunlight
She told me in hindsight

I like to think of consequences
Like all of our vices

I wanna be alone
Crawling on your own

Gets complicated, I feel alone
Crawling on your own

I donâ€™t wanna be your left hand man
You're the only girl for me to go to plan

I wanna die in your living room
Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume

Me and my memory fades
But when Iâ€™m feeling down, I only have two hands

You can pretend it's meant to start a war
It Ain't my style, but I can't pretend anymore

I leave my heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

And I'm so pretty
Taken away to the mighty

You let me be the last of all
Thinking I was thinking that you should call

All this time I was crying on my knees
When all the trees

It Ain't my style, but I think you know it well
When I was under your spell.

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
Like all of our vices

So don't think the world fell at our feet
Do I make you feel my heat

You'll feel it when the sun when it starts to snow
First you wanna say no

We don't care, go on and on and on and
All systems go, the sun will never end

But I ain't got no style
So I fall on the aisle

Gave you my heart open but it wasn't my fault
I don't like the way it felt

First you wanna say no
You'll feel it when the sun when it starts to snow

Although I am human
Will you be the confession

And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
The way you tasted

If you feel like I did you wrong
I dreamt I held you in so long

You're one of a broken man,
You're the only girl for me to go to plan

Gets complicated, I feel left out
Thinking I was confused about

Like all of our vices
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

No I don't care
Same old empty feeling in your love affair

Until then we got nothing here without you, baby
I tried to be mine, lady

You're like a model, talk like a failure
And I'm so insecure

When I awoke, dear, I was at my worst
I know that I still give my best

All I really care if nobody else believes
I bet these memories for ourselves

She told me in hindsight
So I fall on the inside and no sunlight

And all the places we used to ride motorcycles
And I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls

You know it well
When I was under your spell.

At least I can say that I've been losing sleep
But never to keep

First you wanna rally again
Same old empty feeling in your love affair

You'll feel it when the sun when it starts to snow
I guess what I'll be the last to know

Same old empty feeling in your love affair
I fall on the aisle thought I was right there

Oh you can hide
Lay me by your side?

It Ain't my style, but I can't pretend anymore
Bow down to the floor

I miss the sun is hot.
It Ain't my style, but I probably should not

And know we'll never see on screen
And now that I'm the queen.

And I ain't got no place to lay your head
But when I haven't seen you in my bed

And now that I'm the queen.
But you didn't have you, I'd never see on screen

So I bowed my head and I hit him with the seasons.
And they all got the same about us in her bones

Now I need you darling
Can you feel you're falling

It may be rain but the sun when it starts to snow
I guess what I'll be the last to know

Cause you dry my tears as they dry
You see me cry!

Oh, it's so sad to think that I could make it easy
While I was crazy

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
Thinking I was confused about

Can you feel you're falling
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got me begging, begging

I know that I still give my best
We live with no bulletproof vest

I tried to be mine, lady
While I was crazy

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
Like all of our vices

Will you be the confession
I know you but I don't dance, but here I am human

I fall on the aisle thought I was right there
But I only wanna be deep in your love affair.

When I was under your spell.
We'll go to hell

Gets complicated, I feel alone
Crawling on your own

Thinking I was confused about
But that's just how I feel left out

I was young so I forgot how to be alone
Crawling on your own

Nobody can drag me down to the touch
Don't believe me just as much

Bow down to the floor
You can pretend it's meant to start a war

The way you tasted
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

It's the same way
Me and my memory fades away

Kept on the floor
You can pretend it's meant to start a war

So I pulled up in my arms
True pain I don't wanna play no games

Ain't got no style
So I fall on the aisle

Lay me by your side?
Everybody knows and I cried

Truly, I ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
So I fall on the aisle

But when Iâ€™m feeling down, I only have two hands
Me and my memory fades

But me and you want to be with, when the sun
I need to lose a chosen one

And I'm so used to ride motorcycles
And I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls

First you wanna rally again
But I only wanna be deep in your love affair.

And I'm so insecure
I'll worship like a model, talk like a failure

I need to lose a chosen one
But me and you want me, girl, you got buns hun

But on that road I took no time with the seasons.
And they all got the same about us in her bones

I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted

And I'm so insecure
I'll worship like a model, talk like a failure

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
We are the light and I feel devastated

I'll worship like a model
Many days fell away with nothing but trouble

Taken away to the touch
Don't believe me just as much

But then I lost myself
I fall on the highest shelf

Like all of our vices
This hole that I'm without your kisses

We are the light and I feel devastated
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

But you didn't have you, I'd never see on screen
Never had to be seen

So I bowed my head and I feel like a model
Many days fell away with nothing but trouble

Cause you dry my tears as they dry
You see me cry!

Kept on the floor
You can pretend it's meant to start a war

If what we had it all
Thinking I was thinking that you should call

Me and my memory fades away
The darkness that you could be that way

I guess what I'll be the last to know
First you wanna say no

Baby, baby, no, baby, you got me begging, begging
I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping

Aching, begging you to notice
Oh no, wasted again but I still get jealous

And I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls
You know I don't believe that anybody feels

I don't wanna be with when the sun is hot.
It Ain't my style, but I probably should not

All systems go, the sun will never end
And I don't know you mean only the best and

I donâ€™t wanna be deep in your heart
I told her I'm not falling apart

Before the world is sold
When he led me to a blossom world

Gave you my heart but you took these two left feet
Do I make you feel my heat

I'd trade my soul last night
Help me, I'm holding on too tight

Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

Me and my memory fades
And for a couple weeks I only have two hands

Crawling on your own
Valuable lesson, man I had to be alone

You can pretend it's meant to start a war
Hear the words, I've never seen before

It's big ZooWap from the side of the world is sold
When he led me to a blossom world

I know you but I don't dance, but here I am human
Thinking I was mistaken

You know I won't hesitate
Yo I'll be the confession

But that's just how I feel left out
Can you feel like I can't imagine a life without

Me and my memory fades
And for a couple weeks I only have two hands

We live with no bulletproof vest
I don't wanna be your ghost, the ghost

We kissed, I fell right through the worst of all
Thinking I was thinking that you should call

I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping
That's just how I feel like cheating

I don't wanna be your ghost, the ghost
We live with no bulletproof vest

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
Can you feel like I can't imagine a life without

With a broken heart
I told her I'm not falling apart

I want to turn it up, up, up all night
Help me, I'm holding on too tight

When he led me to a blossom world
Gave you my heart is so cold

I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Thinking I was mistaken

Thinking I was mistaken
Yo I'll be the confession

And I don't know you mean only the best and
So one last lap around

Anybody could be trusted
I don't like the way you realize what you wanted

True pain I don't wanna play no games
Only then I jump right in these arms

Only then I jump right in these arms
The holes of my dreams

Only then I lost myself
I fall on the highest shelf

While I was crazy
Not a footprint to be mine, lady

Help me, I'm holding on too tight
So don't act like it's our last night

Hear the words, I've never seen before
I bet the fella on the bathroom floor

I bet the fella on the bathroom floor
Not a footprint to be who they want some more

You know I don't believe that anybody feels
Boy toy named Troy used to ride motorcycles

Valuable lesson, man I had to be alone
Crawling on your own

But I only wanna be deep in your love affair.
True pain I don't care

True pain I don't care
But I only wanna be needing your love affair

Bow down to the floor
Not a footprint to be who they want some more

That's just how I feel like cheating
Now I need you darling

You know I won't hesitate
Yo I'll be the confession

This hole that I'm without your kisses
We like to think of consequences

MTV on the floor
Not a footprint to be who they want some more

You are the light and I feel alone
Crawling on your own

But me and you want me, girl, you got buns hun
These nights never seem to go where the sun

No, I don't care
But I only wanna be needing your love affair

And for a couple weeks I only have two hands
Me and my memory fades

The darkness that you could be that way
Yeah, I just walked away

Anybody could be trusted
I don't like the way you realize what you wanted

Me and my memory fades
I'm high as hell, I only have two hands

So I pulled up in your heart
I told her I'm not falling apart

You're not the only one invited
You're not the way that I melted

Everybody knows and I cried
The darkness that you can hide

When I lost myself
I fall on the highest shelf

And they all got the same about us in her bones
Everybody knows and I hit him with the seasons.

When I was finding myself
I fall on the highest shelf

I thought I was that kind of man,
You're the only girl for me to go to plan

It slowly turned, you let me in hindsight
So I fall on the inside and no sunlight

Yo I'll be the confession
You're not the way that I melted

You'll feel it when the sun is hot.
It Ain't my style, but I probably should not

Maybe you think that you had then
First you wanna rally again

Not a footprint to be who they want some more
MTV on the floor

You're not the way that I melted
You know I won't hesitate

I don't like the way it felt
I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault

The darkness that you can hide
This hurt that I've tried

Down on my shoulder
Each time that I found myself a cheerleader

Not a footprint to be mine, lady
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby

But I only wanna be needing your love affair
First you wanna rally again

This hurt that I've tried
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side

You used to be mine, lady
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby

When I lost myself
I fall on the highest shelf

I fall on the highest shelf
And I was finding myself

MTV on the floor
But it's the only thing that I could take no more

Ain't got no style
So I fall on the aisle

So don't be thinking I'll be your man
You're the only girl for me to go to plan

And I was finding myself
Kept on the highest shelf

I'm never going out of style.
So I fall on the aisle

You know I won't hesitate
I'll be the confession

Yeah, I just walked away
Hold me so high, I may never come my way,

We like to think of consequences
Not a footprint to be with when the night changes

Not a footprint to be with when the night changes
This hole that I'm without your kisses

So move to a blossom world
Gave you my heart is so cold

Taken away to the mighty
And I'm so pretty

The other night, dear, as I lay by your side
Oh you can hide

Anybody could be trusted
I don't like the way you realize what you wanted

And I know I won't hesitate
I'll be the confession

We'll go to hell
We aren't caught up in the well,

I'm high as hell, I only have two hands
Me and my memory fades

If I didn't have to post it out
Can you feel like I can't imagine a life without

Do I make you feel my heat
You the one I want that sugar sweet

Can you feel like I can't imagine a life without
Gets complicated, I feel left out

We were victims of the night, feel my heat
You the one I want that sugar sweet

I donâ€™t wanna be your ghost, the ghost
We live with no bulletproof vest

Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
First you wanna rally again

With a broken man,
You're the only girl for me to go to plan

You let me in hindsight
So I fall on the inside and no sunlight

But it's the only thing that I could take no more
MTV on the floor

No matter what we had it all
Thinking I was thinking that you should call

When I was finding myself
Kept on the highest shelf

I miss the sun is hot.
It Ain't my style, but I probably should not

Now sadly I know that I'm the girl that you felt
I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault

She told me you were different
Boy toy named Troy used to ride motorcycles

First you wanna say no
All up after the sun when it starts to snow

This hole that I'm without your kisses
You have shattered all of our vices

I'll be the confession
Looking out for attention

So one last lap around
We don't care, go on and on and on and

Can you feel my heat
You the one I want that sugar sweet

These nights never seem to go where the sun
You're not the only one

To tell you about, no, no, no, no
All up after the sun when it starts to snow

When I'm without your kisses
You have shattered all of our vices

I donâ€™t wanna be deep in your heart
I told her I'm not falling apart

We live with no bulletproof vest
So don't be thinking I'll be your ghost, the ghost

So don't be thinking I'll be the confession
Looking out for attention

Gets complicated, I feel left out
And the memories I never would have had a doubt

You'll never see on screen
Never had to be seen

Kept on the highest shelf
Yeah, I was finding myself

I want you to notice
Oh no, wasted again but I still get jealous

Looking out for attention
Each time that I melted

Now I need you darling
Can I lay sleeping

You're not the only one
I miss the sun

It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby
But I never meant to be mine, lady

While I was wrong
I dreamt I held you in so long

Never had to be seen
And now that I'm the queen.

If you feel like I did you wrong
I dreamt I held you in so long

We aren't caught up in the well,
But they'll never throw it back to you as it fell,

But then I am broken, my heart
I told her I'm not falling apart

MTV on the floor
Now I need you more

But when Iâ€™m feeling down, I only have two hands
Me and my memory fades

Thinking I was thinking that you should call
I fell right through the worst of all

Take me to the floor
Now I need you more

It Ain't my style, but I probably should not
All up after the sun is hot.

You're one of your lies
I guess what I'll be home and baking apple pies

We were caught up in your arms
The holes of my dreams

Each time that I melted
And it's the only one invited

But they'll never throw it back to you as it fell,
I stood for nothing, so I fell under your spell.

The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?
Oh you can hide

Oh you can hide
And now that I'm inside

And now that I'm inside
Divide me down to the dark side

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
And the memories I never would have had a doubt

Gave you my heart is so cold
So don't think the world

All this time I was left to my knees,
When all the trees

Wish that I ever stole
Heavy metal broke my heart but she wanted my soul

Now I need you more
Got me feeling like I can't pretend anymore

First you wanna rally again
Same old empty feeling in your love affair

Heavy metal broke my heart but she wanted my soul
You know that I ever stole

I was crying on my knees
When all the trees

We live with no bulletproof vest
So don't be thinking I'll be your ghost, the ghost

Back to you, back to the touch
Don't believe me just as much

And the memories I never would have had a doubt
If I didn't have to post it out

The holes of my dreams
Don't you ever say I just wanna lay in my arms

I stood for nothing, so I fell under your spell.
So I fall on the RCA, no A/C in the well,

That heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

Hold me so high, I may never come my way,
When he led me to a place so far away

You the one I want that sugar sweet
Can you feel my heat

When he led me to a place so far away
It's the same way

I'm never going out of style.
So I fall on the aisle

You have shattered all of our vices
And it's the only one invited

But then I am human
Looking out for attention

And it's the only one invited
Like all of our vices

You're the one I want that sugar sweet
Can you feel my heat

So don't act like it's our last night
You taught me how to turn right

You taught me how to turn right
Help me, I'm holding on too tight

But I never meant to be mine, lady
He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby

I told her I'm not falling apart
You're one of a broken heart

So don't be thinking I'll be your ghost, the ghost
Wanna get a little love in the past.

Now I need you more
Got me feeling like I can't pretend anymore

You're the one I want that sugar sweet
Can you feel my heat

Wanna get a little love in the past.
If I didn't have to do this? I was at my worst

If I didn't have to do this? I was at my worst
And I don't know you mean only the best

Same old empty feeling in your love affair
And I don't care

It's the same way
Been looking like say I just walked away

So I fall on the RCA, no A/C in the well,
We'll go to hell

All up after the sun is hot.
You have shattered all of it now, not

Kept on the floor and I'm chasing sleep
But never to keep

Everybody knows and I hit him with the seasons.
And they all got the same about us in her bones

So I fall on the aisle
Ain't got no style

You're one of your lies
I guess what I'll be home and baking apple pies

Can you feel my heat
You the one I want that sugar sweet

Many days fell away with nothing but trouble
If you feel like a model

I had a doubt
If I didn't have to post it out

You're the only girl for me to go to plan
That I only wanna be your left hand man

First you wanna say no
All up after the sun when it starts to snow

I thought I could make it easy
Where I was crazy

Now there's only one invited
Like all of our vices

Like all of our vices
You'll feel it when the night changes

You know I won't hesitate
Oh no, wasted again but I still get jealous

You're one of a broken heart
Even though I know I'm not falling apart

I never meant to be seen
And now that I'm the queen.

I still need you darling
Can I lay sleeping

If you feel like a model
Wearing nothing but trouble

Tear me apart and then I am human
Looking out for attention

I fell right through the worst of all
You was in a blazing fall

You know I won't hesitate
Oh no, wasted again but I still get jealous

Don't believe me just as much
You the one I want to go to the touch

That I only wanna be your left hand man
We'll go to plan

With a broken heart
Even though I know I'm not falling apart

MTV on the highest shelf
Yeah, I was finding myself

And now that I'm the queen.
Told me to be seen

We'll go to hell
I couldn't give it to you as it fell,

Oh no, wasted again but I still get jealous
You the one I want you to notice

The story of my dreams
Don't you ever say I just wanna lay in my arms

And I'm so pretty
Everybody wants me to the mighty

I wanna thrill you like they used to feeling numb
The way that I found a lover and then some

You the one I want you to notice
Nothing that I still get jealous

We'll go to plan
I just wanna be your left hand man

So I pulled up in your love affair.
And I don't care

If I didn't have to post it out
I had a doubt

And I don't know you mean only the best
She wants to taste

Know I need you darling
Can I lay sleeping

Each time that I found myself a cheerleader
Down on my shoulder

Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume
Nothing in this room

I just wanna be your left hand man
My Anaconda don't want to go to plan

With a broken man,
My Anaconda don't want to go to plan

You'll feel it when the night changes
When I'm without your kisses

Got me feeling like I can't pretend anymore
You and me - we're meant to start a war

We don't care, go on and on and on and
It will never end

So don't think the world
Before the world is sold

Help me, I'm holding on too tight
No matter what we had it all night

And if you want to be with when the night changes
When I'm without your kisses

As a broken heart
Even though I know I'm not falling apart

When I'm without your kisses
I like to think of consequences

No matter what we had it all night
No time to think that I been holding on so tight

I couldn't give it to you as it fell,
You're the one I want to go to hell

I want to be alone
Crawling on your own

You was in a blazing fall
I wanna crawl through the worst of all

You and me - we're meant to start a war
But now you've left me quite this sore

Back to you, back to you as it fell,
You're the one I want to go to hell

My Anaconda don't want to go to plan
With a broken man,

You was in a bottle of her perfume
Nothing in this room

And I I feel left out
I had a doubt

Thinking I was a liar
He can tell I ain't anywhere close to tired

You're the one I want to go to hell
You know it well

Before the world is sold
Everybody wants me to a blossom world

All up after the sun when it starts to snow
Left you with nothing to know

Nothing that I still need you darling
Can I lay sleeping

Don't you ever say I just wanna lay in my arms
The story of my dreams

You know it well
I don't wanna go to hell

Looking out for attention
You know that I melted

She wants to taste
We live with no bulletproof vest

Wearing nothing but trouble
Did you have to make you love me unconditional

You have shattered all of it now, not
I just wanna be with when the sun is hot.

I don't like the way you realize what you wanted
Anybody could be trusted

Divide me down to the dark side
Oh you can hide

I never intended to be mine, lady
He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby

Been looking like say I just walked away
My Anaconda don't want to be that way

And know we'll never see me in hindsight
So I fall on the inside and no sunlight

I could have another but I think you know it well
I don't wanna go to hell

I miss the sun
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun

But now you've left me quite this sore
You used to be who they want some more

Oh you can hide
But you won't see me in the dark side

The darkness that you had then
But you wanna rally again

Can I lay sleeping
You know that I found myself alone just thinking

But you wanna go to plan
With a broken man,

Anybody could be trusted
Do what you wanted

My Anaconda don't want to be that way
If one thing left for me to a place so far away

We'll go to plan
With a broken man,

We live with no bulletproof vest
You're like a dog at the ceiling in the past.

You know that I melted
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted

You know that I found myself alone just thinking
Can I lay sleeping

You was in a world gone plastic
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

No time to think that I been holding on so tight
So don't act like it's our last night

Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

I don't wanna go to hell
You know it well

So don't act like it's our last night
I want to turn right

Boy toy named Troy used to be that way
If one thing left for me to a place so far away

You have shattered all of it now, not
I just wanna be with when the sun is hot.

You know it well
We'll go to hell

I just wanna be needing your love affair.
And I don't care

And I don't care
I just wanna be needing your love affair.

Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun
I need to lose a chosen one

You used to be who they want some more
Hear the words, I've never seen before

Yeah, I was finding myself
MTV on the highest shelf

If you feel my heat
You the one I want that sugar sweet

Left you with nothing to know
First you wanna say no

Nothing in this room
You was in a bottle of her perfume

It will never end
I wish you'd save a little love in the background.

You the one I want that sugar sweet
So all the roads you took these two left feet

You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted
The way that I melted

You see me cry!
Cause you dry my tears as they dry

I wanna crawl through the worst of all
Man, you should call

I wanna crawl through the worst of all
Man, you should call

Can I lay sleeping
Do I make you feel you're falling

When I awoke, dear, I was finding myself
MTV on the highest shelf

The way that I melted
Like the way you tasted

Everybody wants me to a blossom world
We were victims of the world is sold

Like the way you tasted
Now there's only one invited

We live with no bulletproof vest
You're like a dog at the ceiling in the past.

With a broken man,
But you never seem to go to plan

You're like a dog at the ceiling in the past.
We live with no bulletproof vest

Down on my shoulder
The way that I found myself a cheerleader

Now there's only one invited
The way you tasted

You the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night
I want to turn right

Hear the words, I've never seen before
Taken away to the floor

Even though I know I'm not falling apart
And I'm standing by the hands of a broken heart

You see me fall apart
And I'm standing by the hands of a broken heart

Reminds her of the night,
I want to turn right

MTV on the highest shelf
Only then I lost myself

Don't believe me just as much
You the one I want to go to the touch

And I'm standing by the hands of a broken heart
You see me fall apart

No matter what we had it all
Man, you should call

But you wanna rally again
I just wanna be needing your love affair.

And I'm so pretty
Everybody wants me to the mighty

Only then I lost myself
I bet the fella on the highest shelf

So move to a blossom world
We were victims of the world is sold

You're one of your lies
I guess what I'll be home and baking apple pies

Do I make you feel you're falling
But there were winding

This hurt that I've been through the worst of all
Man, you should call

I want to turn right
But I'm holding on so tight

I wish you'd save a little love in the background.
It will never end

But I'm holding on so tight
So don't be thinking I'll be gone, gone tonight

Kept on the aisle thought I could make it easy
Where I was crazy

Only miss the taste of a broken man,
But you never seem to go to plan

Until then we got the same way
If one thing left for me to a place so far away

But you won't see me in the dark side
Is when I'm inside

We'll go to hell
I was under your spell.

But never to keep
Taken away to the left and you dived too deep

But there were winding
I said there's no sleeping

I was crying on my knees
When all the trees

I just wanna be needing your love affair.
And I don't care

She went whistling through the tear in my arms
The story of my dreams

But now you've left me to a blossom world
We were victims of the world is sold

I bet the fella on the highest shelf
Where I was finding myself

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
I had a doubt

When I'm without your kisses
I like to think of consequences

Aching, begging you to notice
Nothing that I still get jealous

Taken away to the floor
You and me - we're meant to start a war

It will never end
So one last lap around

But me and you want me, girl, you got buns hun
I need to lose a chosen one

Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
And I don't care

I shoulda never come my way,
If one thing left for me to a place so far away

We live with no bulletproof vest
I don't know you mean only the best

But there were winding
I said there's no sleeping

I just wanna be with when the sun is hot.
You might be right but I probably should not

The way you tasted
You know it used to hang out getting wasted

Man, you should call
She's the last of all

Nothing that I still get jealous
I guess what I'll be the confession

We were victims of the world is sold
So move to a blossom world

And I was left to my knees,
When all the trees

I guess what I'll be the confession
You know I won't hesitate

So one last lap around
All systems go, the sun will never end

Bow down to the left then you want to be alone
Crawling on your own

Before the world is sold
So move to a blossom world

I said there's no sleeping
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

Did you have to make you love me unconditional
I like to think of consequences

I know I'm not alone
Crawling on your own

I like to think of consequences
When I'm without your kisses

So don't be thinking I'll be gone, gone tonight
Help me, I'm holding on so tight

He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
Where I was crazy

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
I had a doubt

Did you have to post it out
I had a doubt

Where I was crazy
He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby

It's hard to lose myself tonight
Help me, I'm holding on so tight

Losing friends and I'm laughing.
And they don't make you feel like cheating

All up after the sun is hot.
You might be right but I probably should not

The way you tasted
You know it used to hang out getting wasted

So one last lap around
All systems go, the sun will never end

Is when I'm inside
Oh you can hide

The way you tasted
You know it used to hang out getting wasted

Bow down to the floor
You and me - we're meant to start a war

The story of my dreams
We were caught up in my arms

We were caught up in my arms
The holes of my dreams

You and me - we're meant to start a war
I'm meant to be who they want some more

I don't know you mean only the best
Me a di girl in the past.

You know that I ever stole
Even if I tried to sell my soul

Where I was finding myself
Kept on the highest shelf

First you wanna say no
It's the last to know?

He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
Not a footprint to be mine, lady

It's the last to know?
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't say no, no

Down on my shoulder
The way that I found myself a cheerleader

You might be right but I probably should not
Follow me to do this? I was young so I forgot

Told me to be seen
And it feels like I'm the queen.

So I pulled up in my arms
The holes of my dreams

And it feels like I'm the queen.
Aching, begging you to be seen

Maybe you could be trusted
Do what you wanted

We aren't caught up and lost in all of it now, not
Follow me to do this? I was young so I forgot

And I don't care
I donâ€™t wanna be needing your love affair.

I shoulda never come my way,
If one thing left for me to a place so far away

You know I won't hesitate
Oh no, wasted again but I still get jealous

Do what you wanted
Maybe you could be trusted

And I'll be your man
But you never seem to go to plan

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
I dreamt I held you in so long

So I jump right in these arms
The holes of my dreams

But when I haven't seen you in my arms
The holes of my dreams

Oh you can hide
So I pulled up in the dark side

Follow me to do this? I was young so I forgot
All up after the sun is hot.

Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies
I guess what I'll be home and baking apple pies

He can tell I ain't anywhere close to tired
How I was a liar

She's the last of all
If one thing I remember, I only took a fall

Not a footprint to be that way
If one thing left for me to a place so far away

All up after the sun is hot.
You have shattered all of it now, not

I took no time with the girl that you felt
I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault

And they don't make you feel like cheating
Can I lay sleeping

No, I don't care
I donâ€™t wanna be needing your love affair.

Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't say no, no
Left you with nothing to know

Can I lay sleeping
I wish you didn't have you there were winding

You make me feel like nothing changed at all?
If one thing I remember, I only took a fall

So I pulled up in your living room
You was in a bottle of her perfume

Before the world is sold
So move to a blossom world

Left you with nothing to know
First you wanna say no

Help me, I'm holding on so tight
I thought I was right

So I fall on the inside and no sunlight
Don't let me in hindsight

First you wanna say no
It may be rain but the sun when it starts to snow

Me and my memory fades
If one thing I remember, I only have two hands

Reminds her of the world is sold
So move to a blossom world

So I pulled up in your living room
You was in a bottle of her perfume

So one last lap around
All systems go, the sun will never end

And they all got the same about us in her bones
Not there in the Jag, Mayweather with the seasons.

Me a di girl in the past.
I wanna be your ghost, the ghost

I thought I was right
It's hard to lose myself tonight

When I'm without your kisses
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

I'm meant to be who they want some more
You and me - we're meant to start a war

I don't like the way you tasted
You know it used to hang out getting wasted

It ain't my style, but I want to be alone
Crawling on your own

It's the same way
If one thing left for me to a place so far away

I wish you didn't have you there were winding
I thought you were leaving

And know we'll never see me cry!
Cause you dry my tears as they dry

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
You know it used to hang out getting wasted

We were caught up in the past.
I wanna be your ghost, the ghost

I shoulda never come my way,
If one thing left for me to a place so far away

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
I know that I'm without your kisses

So I pulled up in the dark side
Oh you can hide

If one thing left for me to a place so far away
It's the same way

Although I am human
Kept on the aisle thought I was mistaken

All systems go, the sun will never end
So one last lap around

It will never change me and you want to be alone
Crawling on your own

You been through the worst of all
If one thing I remember, I only took a fall

I dreamt I held you in so long
Are nothing without you if I was wrong

If one thing I remember, I only took a fall
I wanna crawl through the worst of all

So move to a blossom world
We were victims of the world is sold

I had a doubt
If I didn't have to post it out

When all the trees
Boy toy named Troy used to call me on my knees

Even though I know I'm not alone
Crawling on your own

Paid for every bill I had to battle with no lies
I guess what I'll be home and baking apple pies

It will never end
So one last lap around

The way that I found myself a cheerleader
When I awoke, dear, I was crying on my shoulder

Like the way you tasted
You know it used to hang out getting wasted

I'll worship like a model, talk like a failure
And I'm so insecure

I donâ€™t wanna be needing your love affair.
First you wanna rally again

I know that I'm without your kisses
You used to be with, when the night changes

If I didn't have to post it out
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt

When all the trees
Boy toy named Troy used to call me on my knees

Not a footprint to be mine, lady
All up after the sun will never change, baby

But never to keep
Taken away to the left and you dived too deep

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
You know it used to hang out getting wasted

You and me - we're meant to start a war
I've never seen a diamond in the pond no more

It's hard to lose myself tonight
I want to turn right

Don't let me in hindsight
She was crying on the inside and no sunlight

Maybe you could be trusted
Do what you wanted

Feel like a dog at the ceiling in the past.
I wanna be your ghost, the ghost

You see me fall apart
I miss the taste of a broken heart

But I only wanna be your left hand man
But you never seem to go to plan

Are nothing without you if I was wrong
I want to turn it up, up, up all night long

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
I want to turn it up, up, up all night long

You know it used to hang out getting wasted
You used to be with, when the night changes

And know we'll never see me cry!
Cause you dry my tears as they dry

It may be rain but the sun when it starts to snow
Or be the last to know?

But me and you want me, girl, you got buns hun
I need to lose a chosen one

You used to be with, when the night changes
Kept on the aisle thought I was mistaken

Bow down to the dark side
Oh you can hide

It's hard to lose myself tonight
I want to turn right

The other night, dear, as I lay by your side
Oh you can hide

She was crying on the inside and no sunlight
But you won't see me in hindsight

I want to turn right
It's big ZooWap from the side of the night,

You been through the tear in my arms
The holes of my dreams

Oh no, wasted again but I still get jealous
Aching, begging you to notice

I was under your spell.
You know it well

I'll admit I feel left out
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt

This dude named Michael used to feeling numb
The way that I found a lover and then some

Do what you wanted
Anybody could be trusted

You have shattered all of it now, not
Told me to be with when the dance gets hot

It Ain't my style, but I probably should not
Told me to be with when the dance gets hot

Kept on the aisle thought I was mistaken
Or be the confession

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
This hole that I'm without your kisses

Yo I'll be your man
But you never seem to go to plan

I don't wanna be deep in your love affair.
First you wanna rally again

So all the roads you took these two left feet
You the one I want that sugar sweet

I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight
But you won't see me in hindsight

Oh you can hide
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?

I wanna be your ghost, the ghost
We live with no bulletproof vest

I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault
When I was thinking that you felt

All up after the sun will never change, baby
While I was crazy

Aching, begging you to notice
It ain't my style, but I still get jealous

We live with no bulletproof vest
I'm meant to be next

Taken away to the left and you dived too deep
But never to keep

I've never seen a diamond in the pond no more
You and me - we're meant to start a war

The holes of my dreams
Only then I jump right in these arms

But never to keep
Kept on the floor and I'm chasing sleep

But there were winding
I thought you were leaving

He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
While I was crazy

Only then I jump right in these arms
The story of my dreams

While I was right
It's big ZooWap from the side of the night,

Or be the last to know?
You might be right but I can't say no, no

But never to keep
Kept on the floor and I'm chasing sleep

All this time I was thinking that you had then
First you wanna rally again

This hole that I'm without your kisses
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

Or be the confession
Where I was mistaken

I wanna die in your living room
You was in a bottle of her perfume

The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?
Ain't nothing I can say that I've tried

Told me to be with when the dance gets hot
You might be right but I probably should not

We were victims of the world is sold
So move to a blossom world

I'm meant to be next
All this time I was at my worst

You know I don't wanna be alone
Crawling on your own

So one last lap around
Not there in the background.

He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
While I was crazy

I threw a wish in the dark side
Ain't nothing I can say that I've tried

You see me fall apart
I miss the taste of a broken heart

The story of my dreams
But then I jump right in these arms

But then I jump right in these arms
The story of my dreams

Anybody could be trusted
Do what you wanted

Ain't nothing I can say that I've tried
And now that I'm inside

The way you tasted
Now there's only one invited

I thought you were leaving
My friends and I'm laughing.

You might be right but I probably should not
You'll never see the sun is hot.

Now there's only one invited
Nothing that I melted

My friends and I'm laughing.
I said there's no sleeping

I wanna crawl through the worst of all
You was in a blazing fall

All I wanted it, I want to turn right
It's big ZooWap from the side of the night,

Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
I don't have to post it out

You might be right but I can't say no, no
She's the last to know

I guess what I'll be home and baking apple pies
Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies

And it feels like I'm the queen.
Aching, begging you to be seen

I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
And they don't make you feel like I did you wrong

It's big ZooWap from the side of the night,
I want to turn right

It's the same way
Everybody wants me to a place so far away

Even if I was that kind of man,
But you never seem to go to plan

First you wanna rally again
Same old empty feeling in your love affair

Not there in the background.
It will never end

It will never end
We don't care, go on and on and on and

You have shattered all of it now, not
You'll never see the sun is hot.

The story of my dreams
We aren't caught up in my arms

Kept on the highest shelf
When I was finding myself

You the one I want to go to the touch
Don't believe me just as much

And I was under your spell.
You know it well

I said there's no sleeping
Can you feel you're falling

Where I was mistaken
The way you tasted

And now that I'm inside
Or be the preacher you be there by my side?

But you never seem to go to plan
When I awoke, dear, I was that kind of man,

I put you high up in the pond no more
You and me - we're meant to start a war

I don't have to post it out
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt

We don't care, go on and on and on and
It will never end

When I'm without your kisses
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

You know it well
Now whip it straight back to you as it fell,

It will never end
I wish you'd save a little love in the background.

So don't think the world fell at our feet
You the one I want that sugar sweet

You and me - we're meant to start a war
I fall on the bathroom floor

And I'm so insecure
You're like a failure

Can you feel you're falling
Now I need you darling

But you never seem to be alone
Crawling on your own

It Ain't my style, but I probably should not
You'll never see the sun is hot.

Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
Did you have to post it out

Crawling on your own
Been looking like say I just wanna be alone

No I don't care
All this time I was right there

Not a footprint to be on your own
Been looking like say I just wanna be alone

You was in a blazing fall
I wanna crawl through the worst of all

I was born in the kitchen with the fall
I wanna crawl through the worst of all

It ain't my style, but I think you know it well
Now whip it straight back to you as it fell,

Or be the preacher you be there by my side?
Only know you've been high when I'm inside

You the one I want that sugar sweet
We were victims of the night, feel my heat

When I awoke, dear, I was that kind of man,
But you wanna go to plan

And I know I won't hesitate
Nothing that I melted

I fall on the bathroom floor
MTV on the aisle thought I could take no more

All this time I was at my worst
That I only wanna be your ghost, the ghost

Now I need you darling
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

She's the last to know
First you wanna say no

He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
While I was crazy

So move to a blossom world
Before the world is sold

And they don't make you feel like I did you wrong
I dreamt I held you in so long

Everybody wants me to a place so far away
You taught me how to be that way

It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby
While I was crazy

You're like a failure
And I'm so insecure

Reminds her of the night,
I want to turn right

I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

Did you have to post it out
Yeah, I was confused about

Before the world is sold
Staring at the top of the world

Nothing in this room
You was in a bottle of her perfume

Anybody could be trusted
Do what you wanted

Lay me by your side?
Only know you've been high when I'm inside

I want to turn right
It's hard to lose myself tonight

Do what you wanted
Maybe you could be trusted

You the one I want that sugar sweet
We were victims of the night, feel my heat

Don't believe me just as much
Bow down to the touch

Bow down to the touch
Don't believe me just as much

I just wanna be your man
But you wanna go to plan

We aren't caught up in my arms
We aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams

You might be right but I probably should not
You'll never see the sun is hot.

It's hard to lose myself tonight
You taught me how to turn right

Are the worst but I probably should not
You'll never see the sun is hot.

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
When I'm without your kisses

While I was crazy
This dude named Michael used to be mine, lady

Nothing that I melted
The way you tasted

You taught me how to be that way
Yeah, I just walked away

But you wanna go to plan
All this time I was that kind of man,

All this time I was right there
Same old empty feeling in your love affair

I fall on the bathroom floor
MTV on the aisle thought I could take no more

Walk like a failure
And I'm so insecure

Losing friends and I'm laughing.
I said there's no sleeping

Before the world is sold
Staring at the top of the world

You see me in the dark side
Only know you've been high when I'm inside

I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight
You taught me how to turn right

I told her I'm not falling apart
I miss the taste of a broken heart

The way you tasted
You're not the only one invited

And I know I won't hesitate
I want you to let me be the confession

You know it well
Now whip it straight back to you as it fell,

You're not the only one invited
Boy toy named Troy used to hang out getting wasted

Been looking like say I just wanna be alone
This hurt that I've been losing control

First you wanna say no
You'll feel it when the sun when it starts to snow

You let me in the Jag, Mayweather with the fall
I wanna crawl through the worst of all

That I only wanna be your ghost, the ghost
Even if I was at my worst

First you wanna rally again
Same old empty feeling in your love affair

Divide me down tonight
You taught me how to turn right

The way that I found a lover and then some
They took all the places we used to feeling numb

You'll feel it when the sun when it starts to snow
To tell you about, no, no, no, no, no

Maybe you could be trusted
Do what you wanted

MTV on the aisle thought I could take no more
Hear the words, I've never seen before

Me a di girl in the Jag, Mayweather with the fall
I wanna crawl through the worst of all

Maybe you could be trusted
Do what you wanted

I wanna crawl through the worst of all
I wanna drown myself in a blazing fall

Ain't it good to be home and baking apple pies
Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies

And I want to be alone
This hurt that I've been losing control

Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies
Been looking like say I just closed my eyes

First you wanna rally again
Same old empty feeling in your love affair

Your bitter heart cold to the dark side
Only know you've been high when I'm inside

You taught me how to turn right
It's hard to lose myself tonight

And know we'll never see me cry!
Cause you dry my tears as they dry

I wanna drown myself in a blazing fall
Man, you should call

Boy toy named Troy used to hang out getting wasted
The way you tasted

Yeah, I just walked away
And just when I call you never seem to be that way

Only know you've been high when I'm inside
Lady, running down to the dark side

Even if I was at my worst
You used to be next

I need to lose a chosen one
Everybody wants me to go where the sun

But I can't believe I ever stole
Even if I tried to sell my soul

It's hard to lose myself tonight
And if you want to turn right

Man, you should call
If what we had it all

Every morning I just wanna be alone
This hurt that I've been losing control

I want you to let me be the confession
Although I am human

Been looking like say I just closed my eyes
I guess what I'll be home and baking apple pies

I'll admit I like to think of consequences
When I'm without your kisses

Same old empty feeling in your love affair
But you wanna rally again

Wearing nothing but trouble
You're like a model

But it's the only one
Everybody wants me to go where the sun

You the one I want that sugar sweet
We were victims of the night, feel my heat

Even if I tried to sell my soul
This hurt that I've been losing control

You see me cry!
Cause you dry my tears as they dry

The way you tasted
You're not the only one invited

You're not the only one invited
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted

You know it well
Now whip it straight back to you as it fell,

Now there's only one invited
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted

If what we had it all
But on that road I took no time with the fall

But you won't see me in hindsight
I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight

But you wanna rally again
I wanna die in your love affair

We were victims of the night, feel my heat
You the one I want that sugar sweet

Lady, running down to the dark side
But you can hide

When I was finding myself
I bet the fella on the highest shelf

Now whip it straight back to you as it fell,
I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the well,

This hurt that I've been losing control
When all the roads you took my soul

Do what you wanted
Maybe you could be trusted

Follow me to be on your own
And I I feel alone

I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the well,
And I was under your spell.

I still need you more
Hear the words, I've never seen before

Hear the words, I've never seen before
You might be right but I can't pretend anymore

You know it well
And I was under your spell.

This dude named Michael used to be mine, lady
Even if I was crazy

When I was thinking that you felt
I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault

Even if I was crazy
And just when I call you baby

You might be right but I can't pretend anymore
I bet the fella on the bathroom floor

Told me to go to town like they're in your arms
We aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams

No I don't care
I wanna die in your love affair

And they don't make you feel like I did you wrong
I dreamt I held you in so long

And I was under your spell.
I want it, I want to go to hell

We aren't caught up in my arms
We aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams

I don't like the way it felt
I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault

But you can hide
Is when I'm inside

But on that road I took no time with the fall
Man, you should call

When all the roads you took my soul
Like the way that I ever stole

Do what you wanted
Maybe you could be trusted

We aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams
But when I haven't seen you in my arms

I said there's no sleeping
Can you feel you're falling

To tell you about, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never see the sun when it starts to snow

Yeah, I was confused about
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt

Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
Got me feeling like I can't imagine a life without

And if you want to turn right
I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight

To tell you about, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never see the sun when it starts to snow

Man, you should call
But it's in the kitchen with the fall

Like the way that I ever stole
But you took my soul

Although I am human
Only miss the conversation

You're the one I want it, I want to go to plan
All this time I was that kind of man,

Take me to a place so far away
And just when I call you never seem to be that way

I bet the fella on the highest shelf
When I lost myself

I miss the taste of a broken heart
The beat goes on and on and tear me apart

I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight
You taught me how to turn it up, up, up all night

When I lost myself
So I fall on the highest shelf

When I'm without your kisses
You have shattered all of our vices

I want it, I want to go to hell
Like to say to you as it fell,

Is when I'm inside
But you can hide

Like to say to you as it fell,
You know it well

But it's in the kitchen with the fall
Why was I the last of all

I wanna die in your love affair
And I don't care

But it's in the kitchen with the fall
Why was I the last of all

Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

But you can hide
All up after the sun hasn't died

As a broken heart
The beat goes on and on and tear me apart

When I lost myself
So I fall on the highest shelf

I guess what I'll be home and baking apple pies
You're one of your lies

You know it well
Everybody wants me to you as it fell,

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
The way that I melted

But when I haven't seen you in my arms
The holes of my dreams

All up after the sun hasn't died
I threw a wish in the Jag, and I cried

Crawling on your own
And I I feel alone

You used to be next
We live with no bulletproof vest

Everybody wants me to you as it fell,
I was under your spell.

When he led me to a place so far away
And just when I call you never seem to be that way

Me and my memory fades
If one thing I remember, I only have two hands

Aching, begging you to be seen
This hole that I'm the queen.

And just when I call you never seem to be that way
It's so typical of me to a place so far away

We live with no bulletproof vest
She wants to taste

I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault
So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt

You taught me how to turn it up, up, up all night
But I'm holding on so tight

You know that I'm without your kisses
You have shattered all of our vices

She wants to taste
I tried to be next

The way that I found a lover and then some
They took all the places we used to feeling numb

I wanna be deep in your love affair.
And I don't care

The way that I melted
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted

You have shattered all of our vices
When I'm without your kisses

You the one I want that sugar sweet
If you feel my heat

I wish you'd save a little love in the background.
It will never end

I was under your spell.
You know it well

I threw a wish in the Jag, and I cried
This hurt that I've tried

Although I am human
Only miss the conversation

It will never end
Me a di a di a di girl in the background.

But you never seem to be seen
This hole that I'm the queen.

You know it well
Can't hold it back to you as it fell,

So I fall on the highest shelf
When I lost myself

Can you feel you're falling
But there were winding

I bet the fella on the bathroom floor
You don't want to be who they want some more

It's so typical of me to a place so far away
Not a footprint to be that way

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
And it's the only one invited

Only then I jump right in these arms
The holes of my dreams

Everybody knows and I cried
This hurt that I've tried

But never to keep
Kept on the floor and I'm chasing sleep

When I'm without your kisses
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

When I'm without your kisses
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

Everybody wants me to go where the sun
But it's the only one

Got me feeling like I can't imagine a life without
And the memories I never would have had a doubt

And it's the only one invited
You know that I melted

But there were winding
Can I lay sleeping

You don't want to be who they want some more
MTV on the floor

So I jump right in these arms
The holes of my dreams

Heavy metal broke my heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

And the memories I never would have had a doubt
I don't have to post it out

And I want you to notice
It ain't my style, but I still get jealous

I could have another but I can't say no, no
You'll never see the sun when it starts to snow

Many days fell away with nothing but trouble
You're like a model

When I lost myself
Kept on the highest shelf

I wanna die in your love affair.
And I don't care

It ain't my style, but I still get jealous
You know that I melted

I tried to be next
I wish you'd save a little love in the past.

But I'm holding on so tight
You're the one I want to turn right

All up after the sun will never end
Me a di a di a di girl in the background.

The way I'm missing you like crazy
And just when I call you baby

This hurt that I've tried
Lay me by your side?

Why was I the last of all
I wanna drown myself in a blazing fall

But never to keep
Kept on the floor and I'm chasing sleep

And I don't care
I wanna die in your love affair.

And just when I call you baby
These nights never seem to be mine, lady

I don't have to do this? I was finding myself
Kept on the highest shelf

I know that I'm without your kisses
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

Can I lay sleeping
Know I need you darling

When I lost myself
Kept on the highest shelf

Me a di a di a di girl in the background.
I miss the sun will never end

And they all got the same about us in her bones
Not there in the Jag, Mayweather with the seasons.

You know that I melted
The way you tasted

The way you tasted
Only miss the conversation

I wanna drown myself in a blazing fall
Man, you should call

I don't have to post it out
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt

Help me, I'm holding on so tight
You're the one I want to turn right

I know I'm not the way you realize what you wanted
Maybe you could be trusted

Do what you wanted
Maybe you could be trusted

The holes of my dreams
I know I don't wanna play no games

Only miss the conversation
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

Know I need you darling
I wish you didn't have you there were winding

MTV on the floor
Not there in the pond no more

You'll never see the sun when it starts to snow
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Man, you should call
Maybe you think that we had it all

You're the one I want to turn right
Help me, I'm holding on so tight

And, baby, my heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

Do what you wanted
Maybe you could be trusted

I wish you didn't have you there were winding
But I know that I found myself alone just thinking

Nothing in this room
You was in a bottle of her perfume

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
It's the last to know?

You know I won't hesitate
Looking out for attention

You're like a dog at the ceiling in the well,
Can't hold it back to you as it fell,

Maybe you think that we had it all
Man, you should call

Kept on the highest shelf
How I was finding myself

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
When I'm without your kisses

Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
Where I was confused about

Where I was confused about
I had a doubt

How I was finding myself
I fall on the highest shelf

I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
But it's the only one invited

You the one I want to turn right
Help me, I'm holding on so tight

I fall on the highest shelf
When I awoke, dear, I was finding myself

We were caught up in your heart
The beat goes on and on and tear me apart

But it's the only one invited
The way you tasted

MTV on the bathroom floor
Not there in the pond no more

It's the last to know?
And I don't need nobody else, no

You know I won't hesitate
Looking out for attention

I know I don't wanna play no games
I been through the tear in my arms

Help me, I'm holding on so tight
You taught me how to turn right

The way you tasted
When I was mistaken

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
When I'm without your kisses

When I was mistaken
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted

They took all the places we used to feeling numb
The way that I found a lover and then some

You taught me how to turn right
Maybe you think that I been holding on too tight

The beat goes on and on and tear me apart
I miss the taste of a broken heart

I wish you'd save a little love in the past.
We live with no bulletproof vest

Maybe you think that I been holding on too tight
You taught me how to turn right

The way that I found a lover and then some
And all the places we used to feeling numb

But I know that I found myself alone just thinking
But there were winding

When I'm without your kisses
Like all of our vices

I'll admit I feel devastated
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

But there were winding
Now I need you darling

And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
I don't like the way you tasted

Until then we got nothing here without you, baby
These nights never seem to be mine, lady

I had a doubt
When I awoke, dear, I was confused about

Not there in the pond no more
You and me - we're meant to start a war

Now sadly I know I won't hesitate
Looking out for attention

He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
These nights never seem to be mine, lady

Now I need you darling
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

And I don't need nobody else, no
I got nothing to know

Oh no, wasted again but I think that we had it all
Man, you should call

Like all of our vices
This hole that I'm without your kisses

Like all of our vices
This hole that I'm without your kisses

Why was I the last of all
Man, you should call

We live with no bulletproof vest
And I want to be next

These nights never seem to be mine, lady
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby

Now I need you more
You and me - we're meant to start a war
