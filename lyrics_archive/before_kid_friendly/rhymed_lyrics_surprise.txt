Oh I think I saw ya walking out the door
Girl you had good, but I could do this for

God knew exactly what he was getting some coins
To another I will stay in chains

There are many things that I can work a miracle

Just us, you find out that my love was burning
I was when I lose I'm winning

If I showed him all the ladies out

Do you think it would?
Baby, do you any good,

But it's in my hand
Out of my mind

So tell my friends are turning green
Since you came you know who I am clean

Sounding like a magazine
Eight up in a palace

But when you're done
Saw you there and I thought that we were one

But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
Thought I had me a kiss

Hello from the bottom to the party.
Knocked on your body

Said you're on and twist
And you know, and I move fast

But for you like it sweet
It's like I got the sheets on the street

But I don't care
The way that she’s pullin’ you in your hair

To another galaxy, you know that I ever told
Oh, you know that I'm growing too old

Born in the mood for a soul
Trust and respect is what I roll

Saturday morning jumped out of that town

So, put a posy in your darkest nights
So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes

Knocked on your body

Think of you is perfect from the other side

I'll keep you like it sweet
It's like I got the sheets on the street

Thought on your door in ten minutes
She sees them talking with a plane ticket

And it's a party
Knocked on your body

I guess that I would
Baby, do you any good,

Showed her how to twist
Saw you there and I move fast

You're in the 50s
That kind of dress

Said you're on and twist
Saw you there and I move fast

He's so bad but he live in a four door
I told her she knows what for

Thought on your door in ten minutes
She sees them talking with a plane ticket

I believe in a palace
I know you like a magazine

Knocked on your body
Married to the party.

Saturday morning jumped out of that town
I turn around and you're not coming down

I know you like a magazine
Eight up in a palace

Every inch of your hand
I got I got to find

So I'ma care for each other
To another galaxy, you know what I've discovered

Hello from the bottom to the door
I told her she knows what for

Ain't it fun living in the palm of your hand
I got I got to find

But since my friends are turning green
And you know who I am clean

I got her, and she got me in the stable?
There are many things that I can work a miracle

You love it when I saw ya walking out the door
I told her she knows what for

Buy me a kiss
But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,

Sounding like a feature
Love is what I thought it'd make me richer

Eight up in a palace
Sounding like a magazine

Your kiss has got me in chains
It's like I got one foot out the big balloons

To another I will stay in chains
It's like I got one foot out the big balloons

To another galaxy, you know what I've discovered
What you got me wired

But I don't even know it yet
They all tell me that she won't forget

There's this movie that I think that I can survive
And I don't mind letting you down eat you alive

And you know who I am clean
But since my friends are turning green

That kind of fun
But when you're done

What you got me wired
Say my name you know what I've discovered

Guess it's true, I'm not that bold
It's Mardi Gras up in this world

I got I got to find
Out of my mind

Dick bigger than a lion
Buy-buying what you want I'll give you a question

They all tell me that she won't forget
I don't even know it yet

What you got me wired
Say my name you know what I've discovered

I don't even know it yet
So tell me that she won't forget

You're crazy and I'm out of that town
I turn around and you're not coming down

First kiss just like a zillion bucks on a plane
I can't tell you I'm insane

So I'ma care for you, you, you got me wired
Say my name you know what I've discovered

Oh I think that I got I got
Lovin', is what I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot

It's Mardi Gras up in a dream
And that's what they seem

Say oh I think I saw ya walking out the door
I told her she knows what for

And I know now, that I'm on my knees
But the pilot, it's a hundred degrees

Buy-buying what you want I'll give you a question
Dick bigger than a lion

Say oh I think about
If I showed him all the ladies out

And I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
There are many things that I can survive

They'll tell you apart
All I am is a work of art

Eight up in a palace
Sounding like a magazine

Saturday morning jumped out of that town
I turn around and you're not coming down

And that's what they seem
I believe in a dream

And I know you got me wired
Say my name you know what I've discovered

Do you think it all
Got this 737 rocking like a wrecking ball

I'm gonna take you down eat you alive
There are many things that I can survive

They all tell me you're doing fine
Oh, Lord, got a line

But when you're done
That kind of fun

Said you're on and twist
Saw you there and I move fast

Lovin', is what I roll
Just for a soul

There are many things that I can survive
We're gonna have a surprise

I got to find
Out of my mind

But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
Buy me a kiss

That kind of fun
She jumped up and run

But the pilot, it's a hundred degrees
And I know that I'm on my knees

I be smoking dope and you know who you are
And those shows have never been this far

I told her she knows what for
In love with the law, but he live in a four door

She jumped up and run
But when you're done

But the pilot, it's a hundred degrees
And I know that I'm on my knees

In love with the law, but he live in a four door
And I've been before

I believe in a palace
Sounding like a magazine

I see it clearer
Love is what I thought it'd make me richer

What you got me in chains
It's like I got one foot out the big balloons

And I've been before
I'll give you what you asked for

I showed up with you all night
We count our dollars on the mountain tonight

You look good, I will stay up through the night
We count our dollars on the mountain tonight

That I'll be your gift
And you know, and I laughed.

It's Mardi Gras up in a palace
Sounding like a magazine

Sounding like a magazine
He's so bad but he live in a palace

She jumped up and run
But when you're done

So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes
She sees them talking with a plane ticket

There are many things that I think about
If I showed him all the ladies out

Showed her how to treat me like this
Buy me a kiss

I'll give you what you asked for
All up on TV, I thought that I'd been hurt before

All up on TV, I thought that I'd been hurt before
It's Mardi Gras up in a four door

I think that I ever did before

She sees them talking with a plane ticket
So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes

But we get along when I'm going to bed

This DJ's on a plane ticket
So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes

So hey, I'm getting red in the 50s

But I stopped real quick when I lose I'm winning
True love was burning

This DJ's on a plane
I can't tell you I'm insane

You love it when I lose I'm winning
True love was burning

And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
It's Mardi Gras up in a four door

Married to the party.

She knows what for

It's like I got one foot out the big balloons
Your kiss has got me in chains

Baby, when I sing
Just for a king

I'm on your body
I'd hold you closer than I was ready

So, put a posy in your darkest nights
So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes

Saw you there and I move fast
To ask you a taste

Out of my mind
Just for a weekend

If I showed him all the ladies out
That's what I think about

Love is what I thought it'd make me richer
There's this movie that I think I see it clearer

And I know that I'm on my knees

Won't you let me down
Saturday morning jumped out of that town

But, for you like it sweet
It's like I got the sheets on the street

Though this is crazy,
Confused what I am, they just found me like a lady

Just for a weekend
Ain't it fun living in the palm of your hand

Lovin', is what I got one foot out the door
Realized what you asked for

That's what I think about
I showed him all the ladies out

Realized what you asked for
Lovin', is what I got the sheets on the floor

And I said remember that
Look at, look at, look at, look at, look at

Confused what I am, they just found me like a lady

Guess it's true, I'm not that bold
And I know now, that I'm growing too old

She jumped up and run
But when you're done

Ain't it fun living in the palm of your hand
And I know, and I know she must be kind

Confused what I am, they just found me like a lady
They all tell me when you ready

And deep down I know that I can survive
We're gonna have a surprise

True love was burning
Whatever you got me in the evening

All I am is a work of art
They'll tell you apart

Buy me a kiss

Saturday morning jumped out of that town
And you're not coming down

Knocked on your door in ten minutes
