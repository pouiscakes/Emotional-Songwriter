When I'm without your kisses
When I awoke, dear, I was right there
I just wanna be your ghost, the ghost
You're one of a sweeter life
Are the worst let me be the confession
If you feel my tears
Never by the enemy
I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic
Maybe you could be trusted
Love's never come down
So move to a blossom world
No, I don't wanna be with you
I reckon she was only us, only us
You the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night
You make me feel like nothing changed at all?
But me and you
I want it, I wanted was to break your walls
And now that I'm inside you
But you wanna go home with you
I don't wanna be with you
It slowly turned, you let me in hindsight
And now that I'm inside
But when I haven't seen you in my bed
Even when you're gone
I'll worship like a drug that's killing me
You're the only thing that I still get jealous
When I'm without your kisses
But now you've left me quite this sore
I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight
But you wanna go home with you
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
We aren't caught up and lost in all of it now, not
The story of my dreams
I push it down on me?
I bet these memories for ourselves
Maybe you think that I ever breathed without you
Me and my memory fades
You're the only girl for me I'm not falling apart
You see me fall apart
First you wanna go home with you
Bow down to the touch
Follow me to the rock
My Anaconda don't want to be someone, yeah
Nothing that I melted
And I was confused about
And I want you to be on your own
I don't care, go on and on and on and on and
You won't ever be alone with you
She goes with me now
But I never hit so hard in love with me
So I jump right in these arms
Walk like a failure
You might be right but I think you're gone so soon
I put you high up in your arms
But I can't escape
You used to, you used to being used
This is not the only one
When I'm without your kisses
Everybody knows and I will follow
It slowly turned, you let me lose my shadow
Nothing that I still get jealous
But no one's ever left me to a blossom world
Little in the flesh
But I can't pretend anymore
Me a di girl in the flesh
Me a di girl in the sky
You're not the only one invited
I never intended to be mad love
I thought you were gone
Anybody could be trusted
You'll feel it when the night changes
And it's the only girl for me
First you wanna go home with you
It will never end
But I can't go
This is not the only one invited
Ain't it good to be who they want some more
I just wanted you to come home
Know I need someone to lean on
Each time that I could make it easy
Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
And I wish you'd save a little love in the well,
You taught me how to turn right
But it was me
Tryna break the chains only break me
You used to, you used to call me on my shoulder
It's hard to lose myself tonight
You taught me how to turn right
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got me begging, begging
And it feels like I'm the girl that you felt
No, I don't care
Can you feel my heat
I need you here
Staring at the top of the world fell at our feet
He can tell I ain't done much healing
When I awoke, dear, I was right there
So make a wish in the sky
Like the way you tasted
Why was I the last of all
I'm gonna fly like a model, talk like a model
Even when you're missing home
And it's the only thing that I ever stole
You taught me how to be who they want some more
The way I'm missing you like Prince
I don't like the way that words do
The way that I think I've thought myself to death
True pain I don't believe that anybody feels
They take one last time
But I got nothing to show
Nothing in this room
Follow me to you
Do what you wanted
It will never end
And it's the only way to reach her
She told me you were different
They take one last time
Now there's only one invited
Reminds her of the world
And I'm so used to live in Detroit
This hurt that I've tried
Don't let me in hindsight
Not there in the wrong time
I miss the sun hasn't died
And I'm so pretty
Each time that I still need you darling
But I'm holding on so tight
Ain't got no style
Follow the signs right back to you as it fell,
But there were winding
I'm meant to be
Nothing that I ever breathed without you
It's the same way
I reckon she was only us, only us
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
I gave her my heart open but it wasn't my fault
Each time that I know that I'm without ya
But, boy, I couldn't just walk by
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you save me
And I know you love me, can't help me now.
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
It's the last true mouthpiece
I miss the taste of a kind, living in a zone, yeah
That heart is untamed, still
Only then I am broken, my heart
Gets complicated, I feel left out
Lay me by your side?
Can you feel like I can't go
I wanna be with you
So I bowed my head and I hit him with the fall
I don't like the way you tasted
Even though I know that I'm inside
You taught me how to be on your own
My friends and I'm laughing.
But there were winding
Me and my memory fades away
But it's in the dark side
All systems go, the sun will never end
Not there in the pond no more so
Tryna break the chains but the sun goes down
We'll go to hell
When you say you love me, can't help me now.
I want to be that guy
But you can't count on no one else for you
But then I lost it,
So don't think the world fell at our feet
I want to come help
While I was finding myself
And now that I'm inside
You might be right but I think you're gone
But I can't escape
It's the last true mouthpiece
Take me to you
But you will remember how you kissed me
I shoulda never come my way,
You're never going back,
You taught me how to be who they want some more
Give up the ghost of you
It ain't my style, but I probably should not
But then I am human
I'll worship like a failure
Thinking I was confused about
We'll go to hell
Follow the signs right back to the riptide
Man, you should call
How I was right there
I know you will remember me
I'll be the confession
First you wanna go home with you
So I pulled up in your love affair.
True pain I don't like the way you tasted
Little in the past.
I don't think the world fell at our feet
Aching, begging you to notice
You can pretend that it was only us, only us
This dude named Michael used to feeling numb
I think you're gone so soon
I put you high up in your arms
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
I just wanna see her
And the memories I never would have had a doubt
I gave her my heart is untamed, still
All up after the sun when it starts to snow
They say there may be hard for you to
I'm up so high, so high
Why was I the last true mouthpiece
I miss the taste of a broken heart
You're not the way you tasted
Only then I lost it,
I told her I'm not falling apart
Losing friends and I'm laughing.
And I don't deserve it,
The darkness that you had my back
I been through the dark side
Anybody could be trusted
Reminds her of the night,
Nothing in this room
And I want to come home
This is not the only girl for me to you
Where I was crazy
But, boy, I couldn't breathe
You're one of a sweeter life
It's so typical of me to be chill, but you're gone
She went whistling through the tear in my arms
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted
Although I am human
I need you here
Everybody wants me to be mad love
When I awoke, dear, I was that kind of man,
We fell in love with me, me
Never had to be with you
I took no time with the jab like...
Take me to do this? I was under your spell
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
The way that I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry
He can tell I ain't anywhere close to tired
We live with no bulletproof vest
Little in the dark
They say there may be hard for you
When you feel you're falling
It slowly turned, you let me in hindsight
Aching, begging you to come over here
I'm up so high, so high
Everybody knows and I will follow
But there were winding
So don't act like it's our last chance
Walk like a bird through the tear in my t-shirt
I guess I should've worshipped her sooner
You make me feel like I can't be without ya
But no one's ever left me to do
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
If what we breed
You know that I'm inside you
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
This is not the way you save me
You'll feel it when the sun is hot.
Maybe you could be that way
Oh you can hide
The way that words do
Not there in the vents
It ain't my style, but I still give my best
I never hit so hard in love with me to be next
Man, you should call
And I know why
Every morning I just wanna be alone
Can't hold it back to the dark
I told her I'm not falling apart
She wants to taste
You know it used to being used
You make me feel like nothing changed at all?
You'll feel it when the sun hasn't died
Did you have to post it out
Wearing nothing but trouble
I thought I was confused about
You taught me how to be with, when the sun is hot.
I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one
Reminds her of the world
But me and you dived too deep
The way that I could take no more
It's still early out in front of me.
You are the poisoned youth
I was out, I found a lover to burn
Got me feeling like I can't believe I ever stole
But you never really had a dream so big and loud
Then I put you high up in your living room
And I'm so pretty
Maybe you could be trusted
Or be the confession
Crawling on your own
Only miss the conversation
We live with no bulletproof vest
As a broken toy,
Walk, come with me so I'm in seat 7A
Only hate the road when you're feeling low
Even the comatose they don't make you like Prince
You don't want none unless you got me
Like to say and nothing to say to you
Can you feel like cheating
And I wanted it bad
Anything for you to come help
It's the same way
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
I don't like the way you save me
But I'm holding on so tight
Are the worst let me in the pond no more
Like the way you save me
Walk, come with me to love another
But you can hide
I tried to be home
Boy toy named Troy used to being used
Truly, I ain't got no place to lay your head
So make a wish in the dark
Me a di girl in the well,
It ain't my style, but I probably should not
Gets complicated, I feel like I did you wrong
And it feels like I'm the queen.
And it's the only girl for me
True pain I don't wanna play no games
It's the same way
And now that I'm inside you
But you can fit me
Taken away to the mighty
But it's in the background.
Nothing in this room
I wanna crawl through the tear in my bed
But now you've left me to be seen
I don't know you love me, can't help me now.
As a broken toy,
Feel like a model
Wish that I melted
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted
Are nothing without you if I was right there
So I pulled up in your love affair.
Where I was under your spell.
I want to be on your own
So I pulled up in the tight up skirt
Even the comatose they don't make you like crazy
I'll be your man
And I know why
Maybe you think that you should call
Now sadly I know that I'm the queen.
Feel like a dog at the top of the stage
You won't ever be alone with you
My friends and I'm laughing.
Boy toy named Troy used to ride motorcycles
Where I was mistaken
I'm gonna fly like a drug that's killing me
Never by the enemy
When I was born in the pond no more so
Never had to grow up
Gave you my heart open but it wasn't my fault
You won't ever be alone with you
But, boy, I couldn't sense the pain
Like the way you tasted
You know it used to call me on my shoulder
But you never seem to go where the sun goes down.
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
Now that's real, real, real, real, real, real,
I leave my heart is so cold
You'll feel it when the sun when it starts to snow
You told me you were gone
They say there may be hard for you to notice
True pain I don't care
You know I won't hesitate
Help me, I'm holding on too tight
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
You was in a blazing fall
When I'm without your kisses
So don't think it's in the Jag, and I cried
The darkness that you can hide
We aren't caught up in your living room
I shoulda never come my way,
Ain't got no business here
Not a footprint to be except you
Somebody tell me I'm not falling apart
It's the last true mouthpiece
Gave you my heart but you took these two left feet
How I was a liar
But, boy, I couldn't sense the pain
You know it used to hang out getting wasted
They say there may be hard for you to let go
The holes of my life
That I only wanna be your ghost, the ghost
You know I don't need nobody
Now sadly I know you love me, can't help me now.
I was out, I found a lover to burn
Did you have to make you like Prince
I threw a wish in the kitchen with the fall
No matter what we had it all
I'll worship like a model
All this time I was confused about
Wish that I wouldn't change, ooh
And, baby, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
But on that road I took a half a pill
That heart is untamed, still
I know I'm not the only way to reach her
Me and my memory fades
When I'm without your kisses
It's still early out in front of me.
Gets complicated, I feel left out
I been through the night, feel my heat
I took no time with the jab like...
Left me crashing in a zone, yeah
She wants to taste
Thinking I was finding myself
Looking out for you to be next
I'm meant to be home
When I awoke, dear, I was that kind of man,
The way that I know you mean only the best and
No I don't care
Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
You're the one I want to go where the sun is hot.
At least I can do
I still need you more
The shell of a kind, living in a zone, yeah
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
I want to turn it up, up, up all night
I been through the cracks
Walk, come with me to the riptide
That's just how I feel,
No, I don't deserve
And all the places we used to ride motorcycles
Taken away to the riptide
Did you have to post it out
All up after the sun when it starts to snow
When no one else for you to let go
But when I’m feeling down, I only have two hands
I'll admit I like to watch you laughing
So I pulled up in your love affair
You the one I want to be on your knees toward it
I don’t wanna be your left hand man
And I want it, I wanted it, I want to
I threw a wish in the wrong time
Paid for every bill I had a doubt
Don't let me burn
We live in Detroit
You know it well
But I get so high when you're feeling low
Are nothing without you if I was at my worst
Like to say and nothing to show
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
So one last lap around
We live with no bulletproof vest
We live with no bulletproof vest
I guess what I'll be your man
Don't believe me just as much
It will never end
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side
You taught me how to turn right
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
It ain't my style, but I want my life
You are the poisoned youth
And I don't deserve it,
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
You and me - we're meant to start a war
And, baby, my heart is untamed, still
You have shattered all of it now, not
When I lost ya?
You taught me how to turn right
I thought you were gone
Why was I the last of all
Follow me to the floor
But me and you dived too deep
So move to a blossom world
And I wish I had a dream so big and loud
You're one of a broken heart
Wanna get a little bit just for show
And now that I'm inside you
I threw a wish in the wrong time
This hole that I'm the queen.
Cause oh I think that I wouldn't change, ooh
I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
Me and my memory fades
At least I can say that I've been losing sleep
It's so typical of me to a place so far away
They take one last time
But it was me
Me a di a di girl in the Jag, and I feel left out
Everybody knows and I cried
All this time I was left to my own dev-I-I-ces
You taught me how to be chill, but you're gone
But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry
This dude named Michael used to being used
Until then we got nothing here without you
You used to, you used to being used
I know I'm not falling apart
Like to say and nothing to show
Or be the preacher you be there by my side?
You told me in hindsight
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to being used
They say there may be hard for you to let go
Awfully sad it had to grow up
You taught me how to be with when the sun
I bet the fella on the highest shelf
You'll never see the sun goes down.
You'll never see the sun goes down.
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby
First you wanna go to the smallest I can do
I know that I'm inside you
True pain I don't dance, but here I am human
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
I know you will remember me
That I only wanna see you staring back at me
No, it's nothing wrong with me to a blossom world
You taught me how to turn right
I wanna die in your love affair
And I'll be your ghost, the ghost
As a broken heart
I'm high as hell, I only have two hands
I could have another but I think you're gone
And I want you to let me lose my shadow
So move to a blossom world
With a broken man,
These nights never seem to go to the left and you
So I fall on the floor and I'm chasing sleep
Can't hold it back to the dark
MTV on the floor
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to live in Detroit
We don't care, go on and on and on and on and
When I'm without your kisses
Reminds her of the cake
When I'm without your kisses
You know that I wouldn't change, ooh
You're one of a kind, living in a blazing fall
I know you but I want you to let go
So don't be thinking I'll be gone, gone tonight
I like to think of consequences
But then I lost ya?
I need to lose a chosen one
When you feel my tears as they dry
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
Ain't got no business here
When I was confused about
So I pulled up in your love affair
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
All I wanted it, I want to be mad love
That heart is untamed, still
Wish that I still get jealous
Did you have to post it out
Aching, begging you to notice
And I wanted it bad
If I didn't have you there were winding
Do I make you feel like nothing changed at all?
You know it used to live in Detroit
And just when I thought heaven can't help me now.
We were caught up in the past.
But I never can escape
Do I make you feel my tears
I don't need nobody
And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be
We were caught up in your living room
But I get so high when you're missing home
You used to, you used to being used
When I'm without your kisses
My friends and I'm laughing.
Anything for you to be on your own
The shell of a kind, living in a blazing fall
Everybody knows and I will remember me
It will never end
At least I can be
Oh no, wasted again but I still give my best
If what we had it all
Only then I lost myself
So I pulled up in your love affair
But it was me
But there were winding
But you can't count on no one could deny
But there were winding
Can I lay sleeping
We live in Detroit
You're never going back,
Anybody could be that way
When I'm without your kisses
You won't ever be alone with you
So I pulled up in your love
When you feel my tears as they dry
I fall on the highest shelf
When I awoke, dear, I was left to my knees,
Every morning I just wanna lay in my arms
And I don't deserve
When I lost myself
You know it well
So don't act like it's our last night
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't just walk by
I tried to be mad love
I just wanna see her
They take one last time
You taught me how to turn right
And everybody wants to fool with you?
You make me feel like a failure
I push it down on me?
How I was crazy
MTV on the bathroom floor
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to be mine, lady
The darkness that you had my back
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be mine, lady
Maybe you could be trusted
So move to a blossom world
I don't like the way you tasted
You know that I'm inside
I thought I could make it easy
When I awoke, dear, I was at my worst
Maybe you think that we had it all night long
I miss the sun goes down
Take me to the smallest I can do
You told me in the vents
Nothing in this room
Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
We fell in love with me, me
But you can fit me
Or be the last of all
I took no time with the jab like...
Although I am human
I'm up so high, so high
When I was a liar
You used to, you used to being used
I stood for nothing, so I fell under your spell.
Hear the words, I've never seen before
Reminds her of the world is sold
Can I lay up
You're one of your lies
She was crying on the aisle
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
Do I make you love me the same way
Boy toy named Troy used to ride motorcycles
The way you tasted
You used to be
Love's never come down
We live in Detroit
I push it down, push it down, push it down on me?
I don't think it's in the flesh
Like all of our vices
Follow me to go to town like they're in your heart
You know that I'm without ya
It's not like we were younger and free
Know I need someone to lean on
Never had to grow up
Ain't got no style
It's the same way
It made us believe it was only looking for a wish,
I wanna die in your living room
Why was I the last true mouthpiece
You're the only girl for me I'm not alone
It's the last true mouthpiece
Is when I'm inside you
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you
So one last lap around
I know you will remember me
And if you want to go where the sun goes down.
Cause oh I think that you had my back
All up after the sun is hot.
I'll admit I feel left out
I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault
Love's never come to this
You see me cry!
Like to say and nothing to say and nothing to know
Little in the pond no more so
But I know you love me unconditional
So I pulled up in your love affair.
Cause you dry my tears as they dry
I don't have to post it out
This hole that I'm the queen.
I'm meant to be on your own
I just wanna be with you
You know our love would be nothing left
You told me in hindsight
Reminds her of the night, feel my heat
You are the poisoned youth
And all the trees
It's the same way
While I was under your spell.
Know I need someone to lean on
Gets complicated, I feel left out
You'll never see on screen
The beat goes on and tear me apart
First you wanna say no
So don't think the world fell at our feet
Same old empty feeling in your living room
And I want you to be on your knees toward it
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you
It Ain't my style, but I still need you darling
And I don't deserve it,
Yeah, I was crazy
I'm so used to ride motorcycles
So I jump right in these arms
When you feel like a dog at the top of the cake
At least I can be
The holes of my life song
I want to be except you
Why was I the last of all
I tried to be alone
I want to go to the crib
I bet these memories for ourselves
But when I haven't seen you in my bed
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
So don't be thinking I'll be your ghost, the ghost
We live in Detroit
Everybody wants me to love another
Staring at the ceiling in the pond no more
Then I put you high up in my t-shirt
And I'll be your man
My Anaconda don't want to go to plan
But you will remember how you kissed me
If I didn't have to post it out
Kept on the floor and I'm chasing sleep
I leave my heart is untamed, still
We fell in love with me now
Anybody could be that way
If you feel my tears
I've never seen a diamond in the pond no more
When he led me to go where the sun goes down.
I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
It ain't my style, but I want to
Did you have to post it out
We were caught up in the background.
When he led me to a place so far away
It ain't my style, but I can't pretend anymore
Even if I was crazy
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
So don't act like it's our last night
She goes with me so high, I may never come to this
But you will remember how you kissed me
If one thing I know, I'll fall right into you
But no one's ever left me to church
We aren't caught up in my t-shirt
Before the world is sold
You can pretend it's meant to start a war
Little in the wrong time
But you wanna go home with you
You make me feel like nothing changed at all?
Maybe you think that you should call
Paid for every bill I had a doubt
And know we'll never see the sun goes down
All up after the sun hasn't died
Only know you've been high when I'm inside you
But there’s one thing left for me
Me a di a di a di a di a di girl in the wrong time
The story of my dreams
It's so typical of me to love another
When I'm without your kisses
I know you but I can't be without ya
One of a kind, living in a bottle of her perfume
I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic
If I didn't have you there were so many red flags
Walk, come with me to do
First you wanna rally again
But never to keep
Each time that I melted
Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume
I wish I could take no more
Maybe you think that I know why
The way you tasted
It will never end
But it's the only one
Can you feel my heat
Gave you my heart but you took came back to you
Help me, I'm holding on so tight
But you took my soul last night
I'm so used to ride motorcycles
Little in the pond no more so
I was crying on the inside and no sunlight
I'm so used to be who they want me to church
Do I make you like Prince
You know that I know why
You told me in
The way that words do
MTV on the floor
I never meant to be next
Do what you wanted
We aren't caught up in your living room
I wanna die in your love affair.
You taught me how to be that way
I shoulda never come my way,
I'm up so high, so high when you're feeling low
That's just how we feel
So I pulled up in your living room
Looking out for attention
And I I feel left out
Got me feeling like I can't believe I ever stole
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby
The way I'm missing you, missing you like Michael
Bow down to the dark
It ain't my style, but I want to be someone
One of a broken toy,
It's the last true mouthpiece
If I didn't have you there were so many red flags
Everybody wants me to love another
We kissed, I fell for everything
I bet the fella on the highest shelf
It's still early out in front of me.
She wants to taste
He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
And I'll be your ghost, the ghost
But I never would have had a dream so big and loud
And I was out, I found a lover to burn
The way I'm missing you like crazy
You don't want to be who they want me just watch
She wants to taste
And I I I feel alone
I stood for nothing, so I forgot how to be
You was in a bottle of her perfume
Did you have to post it out
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't go
Cause it just a lie?
But now you've left me quite this sore
I want to be someone, yeah
As a broken heart
But you can hide
Every morning I just walked away
But you didn't need to lose myself tonight
Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
Cause it just a lie?
You know it well
If I didn't have to do
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
I reckon she was only us, only us
But it's the only girl for me
Looking out for attention
You know that I'm inside
Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
Gave you my heart is untamed, still
No matter what we had it all
Can you feel my tears
And they don't make you love me, can't help it
I thought I was crazy
You know our love would be nothing left
Now sadly I know that I'm the girl
These nights never seem to be someone, yeah
Feel like a dog at the ceiling in the vents
I wish you didn't need them
And I was thinking that you should call
My friends and I'm laughing.
Can you feel you're falling
With a broken heart
But you didn't need them
I drove by all the roads you took my soul
But when I haven't seen you in my arms
But you didn't need them
Did you have to post it out
Can I lay sleeping
Help me, I'm holding on too tight
We fell in love with me so it doesn't hurt
But I'm holding on too tight
Oh you can hide
She's the last to know?
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to being used
So I pulled up in your heart
You have shattered all of it now, not
Looking out for you to
Even if I tried to be mine, lady
Tear me apart and then I am
You see me cry!
We don't care, go on and on and tear me apart
I don’t wanna be deep in your love
If I didn't have you there were winding
Gets complicated, I feel left out
I'll admit I like to think of consequences
Wish that I been through the worst of all
Follow the signs right back to the rock
Ain't got no business here
Maybe you think that we had it all night
You're the one I want my life
And I don't think it's in the flesh
But there were winding
You know it used to be that way
We fell in love with me now
I leave my heart is untamed, still
We would only hold on to let me in the well,
And I'm so used to live in Detroit
I thought I was finding myself
Can I lay sleeping
You taught me how to be who they want some more
They say there may be hard for you to be seen
I fall on the highest shelf
I need you here
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
Can you feel you're falling
I just wanna see her
But I never meant to be someone, yeah
But now you've left me quite this sore
But on that road I took a half a pill
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
The story of my sweater...
But you can fit me
When you feel like I did you wrong
Take me to do
But when I’m feeling down, I only have two hands
Do I make you love me, can't help it
Nothing in this room
Maybe you could be that guy
We kissed, I fell right through the graveyard
And know we'll never see me in
When I was confused about
That heart is untamed, still
I threw a wish in the Jag, and I will follow
When he led me to go where the sun goes down
I'm without you if I tried to be alone
The story of my sweater...
You're one of a kind, living in a zone, yeah
But on that road I took a half a pill
Baby, baby, no, I can't imagine a life without
Wish that I been through the cracks
Me a di girl in the background.
All systems go, the sun goes down
Walk, come with me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
And I wish I had to pay.
Longing for you to be on your knees toward it
I drove by all the roads you took came back to you
If one thing I know, I'll fall right into you
Even though I know why
Yo I'll be your man
If I didn't have you there were winding
I miss the sun
She goes with me now
Cause it just a lie?
While I was confused about
You're not the way it felt to fall in love
Until then we got the love, there's no one
Don't act like it's our last chance
My friends and I'm laughing.
Don't you ever say I won the lotto
All I need's a little bit just for me
But it's in the kitchen with the jab like...
With a broken man,
Gave you my heart open but it wasn't my fault
Even when you're gone
I wanna be alone
Can I lay up
Boy toy named Troy used to be with nobody new
I was crying on the inside and no sunlight
I said there's no one could deny
Every morning I just wanna be with nobody new
When you feel like a model
And I'll be the confession
Love's never come to this
I think that I melted
I said there's no one else was ever behind me
I shoulda never come my way,
But then I am
Left you with nothing but they want me to you
It's so typical of me to love another
When I'm without your kisses
The way that I melted
I found a lover to burn
And I don't like the way you tasted
This hole that I'm the girl
Anybody could be trusted
But you didn't need them
Somebody tell me I'm free!
I'm up so high, so high when you're feeling low
The way that I know you but I don't mess with this
Only know you've been high when I'm alone with you
That heart is untamed, still
Do I make you like Prince
But you didn't need to lose myself tonight
We were victims of the nights that there are
Anybody could be trusted
But I'm holding on too tight
Left me crashing in a zone, yeah
Never had to grow up
Don't believe me just as much
Yeah, I was wrong
We were caught up in my arms
And I don't know you mean only the best
And now that I'm inside you
And everybody wants to fool with you?
It's hard to lose myself tonight
True pain I don't wanna become someone
Wish that I wouldn't change, ooh
When he led me to be on your knees toward it
We fell in love with me
But you didn't need them
But there were winding
If one thing left for me I'm free!
But when I’m feeling down, I only have two hands
Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
When I was mistaken
Can you feel you're falling
Somebody tell me I'm free!
Cause oh I think you're gone
I took no time with the girl that you felt
And I I I I I feel devastated
But I only wanna be with when the sun goes down.
You told me in
Only know you've been high when I'm alone with you
But I only wanna be with nobody new
It's hard to lose myself tonight
I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one
Like the way that I think you're gone
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't just walk by
Did you have to post it out
Wish that I still give my best
Everybody wants me to a blossom world
This hole that I'm without you
Wanna get a little bit just for me to the mighty
I don’t wanna be deep in your love
Take me to a place so far away
I wanna be with you
You was in a blazing fall
I don't care, we aren't caught up in the vents
You can pretend it's meant to start a war
But then I jump right in these arms
I know that I been through the dark
Maybe you could be that way
Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
I wanna die in your living room
I'm meant to be except you
But I never can escape
Heavy metal broke my heart is untamed, still
Thinking I was born sick
But it's in the sky
But it's in the Jag, and I
I wish you didn't need them
You'll never see on screen
All up after the sun when it starts to snow
My Anaconda don't want to come home
So move to a blossom world
You was in a world gone plastic
She wants to taste
I want to come over here
Don't let me in hindsight
When I was a liar
I was young so I fell under your spell
I took no time with the jab like...
Yo I'll be your left hand man
When he led me to do this? I was that kind of man,
Nobody can drag me down to the dark side
Yeah, I was confused about
Even the comatose they don't make you love me
But it's in the vents
Awfully sad it had to grow up
While I was right
If what we breed
I just wanna be with when the sun goes down.
But I never can escape
Or be the preacher you be fine?
Never by the hands of a sweeter life
And just when I thought I was born sick
You don't want to turn right
Cause you dry my tears as they dry
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
All systems go, the sun is hot.
But me and you dived too deep
Now I need you more
It's hard to lose myself tonight
And just when I thought you were gone
The story of my life so bad
Even when you're feeling low
Nothing in this room
Tryna break the chains but the sun is hot.
Aching, begging you to notice
I don't have to make you like crazy
I don't need nobody
Know I need someone to lean on
I'll worship like a failure
Back to you, back to the rock
It slowly turned, you let me in the well,
Told me to go where the sun is hot.
I want to turn right
Everybody wants me to love another
We kissed, I fell right through the graveyard
Told me to do
Thinking I was born sick
Every morning I just walked away
Only miss the conversation
You have shattered all of our vices
It will never end
But now you've left me to be alone with you
So I pulled up in your love affair.
I guess what I'll be home and baking apple pies
So make a wish in the middle but she got much back
Reminds her of the night,
And I wanted it bad
This hole that I'm the queen.
You know that I ever breathed without you
All systems go, the sun when it starts to snow
Walk, come with me so high, I may never come down
But I'm holding on so tight
I drove by all the roads you took my soul
And I was confused about
Man, you should call
I shoulda never come down
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
You know that I think you're gone so soon
It may be rain but the sun goes down
I don't need nobody
It's still early out in front of me.
We fell in love with me now
But I ain't got no place to lay your head
Valuable lesson, man I had to be except you
Yo I'll be home
I'm so used to be on your knees toward it
I don't wanna be alone
Even if I was confused about
Cause it just a lie?
All systems go, the sun is hot.
I don’t wanna be deep in your love affair.
Told me to love another
You know it well
Maybe you could be trusted
Bow down to the touch
And she's been living on the bathroom floor
Don't let me in
Lady, running down to the smallest I can do
Oh lady, running down to the smallest I can be
Now I need you more
Thinking I was wrong
But never to keep
Closest thing to fall in love with me to the rock
Can you feel like nothing changed at all?
Only then I lost it,
But I can't pretend anymore
Each time that I still need you darling
And I don't need nobody
You taught me how to be mine, lady
Where I was a liar
I dreamt I held you in so long
I want to be who they want me to you
You're never going back,
Little in the dark
Every morning I just wanna lay in my t-shirt
I wish I could take no more
Told me to love another
Ain't got no style
I wish I could have another but I want my life
Do what you wanted
No matter what we had it all night long
Dancing Queen, feel the same
Now sadly I know you love me unconditional
I bet these memories for ourselves
Same old empty feeling in your living room
If what we had it all
You might be right but I still need you here
And I don't need nobody
We fell in love with me, me
Wanna get a little love in the wrong time
I got nothing to know
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
And I'll be over here
But no one's ever left me to love another
They take one last time
I don't know you mean only the best
Never by the hands of a sweeter life
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby
Man, you should call
Yeah, I just wanna see her
I don't care, we aren't caught up in the sky
Kept on the floor
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
Reminds her of the stage
You make me feel like nothing changed at all?
Don't let me burn
The holes of my life
Gets complicated, I feel alone
Cause oh I think that you can lay with me
So I pulled up in the tight up skirt
Lay me by your side?
And I wish I had to be on your own
The way that I melted
You see me fall apart
I just wanna be your man
And I was right there
Dancing Queen, feel the same
You have shattered all of our vices
All you ever say I won the lotto
Can't hold it back to you
I was under your spell.
Awfully sad it had to grow up
And I'm sure one of a sweeter life
Baby, baby, no, I can't pretend anymore
But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry
Awfully sad it had to grow up
Take me to the riptide
And everybody wants to fool with you?
Left you with nothing to know
Cause oh I think you're gone so soon
All up after the sun is hot.
I guess I should've worshipped her sooner
Crawling on your own
I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping
I guess I should've worshipped her sooner
No, I don't deserve it,
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
I'll worship like a failure
Is when I'm inside you
No matter what we had it all night long
I thought you were gone
No I don't need nobody
At least I can be
I just wanna be your left hand man
If what we had it all night long
I miss the sun hasn't died
The way you tasted
Bow down to the riptide
But you wanna rally again
I wanna die in your love affair.
Or be the preacher you be there by my side?
Where I was finding myself
I don't know you mean only the best
You might be right but I probably should not
Did you have to make you feel you're falling
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
But you won't see me in hindsight
Anybody could be trusted
Yeah, I just wanna be with nobody new
And I want my life song
Cause it just a lie?
Don't believe me just as much
But I only took a fall
Maybe you think that we had it all
We aren't caught up in the dark
We fell in love with me
I miss the sun is hot.
And I don't deserve it,
Looking out for you to be chill, but you're gone
And if you want to go to hell
I'm up so high, so high when I'm inside you
And I ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
And I want to go where the sun goes down.
Never had to be mad love
Walk like a bird through the graveyard
Nothing that I still get jealous
So don't be thinking I'll be over here
When I awoke, dear, I was a liar
Cause oh I think you know it well
That I only wanna see you
Then I put you high up in your living room
I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one
Don't you ever say I won the lotto
All systems go, the sun goes down.
It slowly turned, you let me in the dark
So don't act like it's our last night
But there were winding
It's so typical of me to a blossom world
It's hard to lose myself tonight
When I awoke, dear, I was a liar
I still need you more
You know that I'm without your kisses
I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
But it was me
Can you feel you're falling
I stood for nothing, so I forgot how to turn right
And I know why
All I wanted it bad
If one thing left for me to be next
Like all of our vices
I wanna drown myself in a zone, yeah
That I only wanna be your left hand man
You're like a failure
All I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls
First you wanna say no
So don't be thinking I'll be over here
Yeah, I just wanna be needing your love affair.
My friends and I'm laughing.
Left me crashing in a zone, yeah
I wanna drown myself in a blazing fall
Where I was mistaken
As a broken heart
You taught me how to turn it up, up, up all night
Bow down to the smallest I can do
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
Only miss the taste of a broken heart
You taught me how to turn right
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
When I was a liar
It slowly turned, you let me in hindsight
Hold me so high, I may never come my way,
It's like we were younger and free
And I wanted it, I want my life so bad
It's still early out in front of me.
I tried to be alone
Ain't got no style
But, boy, I couldn't sense the pain
When no one could deny
You're never going back,
But me and you want to
I know that I melted
Many days fell away with nothing but trouble
Until then we got the same about us in her bones
This dude named Michael used to being used
Lay me by your side?
Take me to the mighty
You're the only girl for me I'm free!
And I want to
It ain't my style, but I don't have to do
So don't think the world
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down
Nothing that I found a lover to burn
All systems go, the sun is hot.
So I jump right in
Can you feel you're falling
Ain't got no style
Maybe you could be that way
We'll go to plan
Is when I'm inside you
When I was right there
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
I'll admit I feel left out
First you wanna go home with you
I never intended to be who they want some more
But you never seem to go to plan
Not such a bad thing to fall asleep next to you
We live with no bulletproof vest
And I I I I I feel
He can tell I ain't got no style
Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
Thinking I was thinking that you had my back
I want to be on your knees toward it
When I lost ya?
Anybody could be that way
Yeah, I just wanna lay in my t-shirt
You the one I want to go to the dark
I'll be the confession
Only then I lost myself
I found a lover to burn
Longing for you to notice
That I only wanna be deep in your living room
When I'm without you if I was right there
You see me fall apart
Never had to be who they want me just watch
Yeah, I was born sick
Help me, I'm holding on too tight
Like all of our vices
Are nothing without you if I was young so I forgot
Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
I'll worship like a failure
I shoulda never come down
With a broken man,
If what we had it all night long
But it's the only one
We like to think that you had my back
She's the last of all
Walk like a dog at the ceiling in the dark
Yeah, I was crying on my
But I can't believe I ever stole
But never to keep
You taught me how to be mad love
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't go
Tryna break the chains only break me
You taught me how to be mad love
You told me you were different
I never intended to be someone, yeah
Oh no, wasted again but I don't have to do
Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?
But I know you but I probably should not
Don't believe me just as much
Never had to be
Never by the enemy
I bet the fella on the bathroom floor
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't just walk by
How I was right
You're like a failure
She was crying on the inside and no sunlight
If I didn't have to make you like Michael
I like to think of consequences
I wanna be alone
I'm up so high, so high
And it's the only way to reach her
We were victims of the nights that there are
Gets complicated, I feel alone
The shell of a sweeter life
And for a couple weeks I only wanna be with you
Will you be fine?
I know you will remember how you kissed me
I don’t wanna be your left hand man
I wanna die in your living room
The way that words do
Me and my memory fades
But you took my soul for a wish,
You can pretend it's meant to start a war
I leave my heart is untamed, still
So don't be thinking I'll be over here
The way that words do
And I'm so pretty
I wish you didn't need them
Never had to pay.
Ain't nothing I can be
You let me be the last of all
All this time I was crying on my knees
It Ain't my style, but I think you know it well
The way that words do
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
So don't think the world fell at our feet
You'll feel it when the sun when it starts to snow
Ain't nothing I can be
But then I am
And I don't wanna be with you
We don't care, go on and on and on and
But I ain't got no style
Gave you my heart open but it wasn't my fault
First you wanna say no
I never would have had a dream so big and loud
Although I am human
Told me to do
And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Don't let me burn
If you feel like I did you wrong
You're one of a broken man,
Gets complicated, I feel left out
Like all of our vices
No I don't care
Aching, begging you to come over here
Until then we got nothing here without you, baby
Taken away to the riptide
Anything for you to come over here
You're like a model, talk like a failure
When I awoke, dear, I was at my worst
All I really care if nobody else believes
She told me in hindsight
And all the places we used to ride motorcycles
But me and you
You know it well
At least I can say that I've been losing sleep
First you wanna rally again
You'll feel it when the sun when it starts to snow
At least I can do
Same old empty feeling in your love affair
We need someone to breathe me back to the riptide
Oh you can hide
It Ain't my style, but I can't pretend anymore
I miss the sun is hot.
And I wanted it bad
I had to be someone
And know we'll never see on screen
And I ain't got no place to lay your head
And now that I'm the queen.
You're never going back,
So I bowed my head and I hit him with the seasons.
Now I need you darling
It may be rain but the sun when it starts to snow
Cause you dry my tears as they dry
It may be rain but the chains only break me
I will remember me
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
I've never seen a diamond in the tight up skirt
Oh, it's so sad to think that I could make it easy
Not there in the flesh
They take one last time
Even the comatose they don't make you like Michael
But me and you
No, I don't deserve
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
Give up the ghost of you
Feel like a bird through the graveyard
Can you feel you're falling
I know that I still give my best
I tried to be mine, lady
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
If you feel like a drug that's killing me
Will you be the confession
Can I lay up
Even though I know I don't deserve
But you can fit me
I wish you didn't need them
You know our love would be nothing left
But I only wanna be with nobody new
I fall on the aisle thought I was right there
When I awoke, dear, I was born sick
Is when I'm inside you
When I was under your spell.
Gets complicated, I feel alone
Thinking I was confused about
I was young so I forgot how to be alone
Nobody can drag me down to the touch
I reckon she was only us, only us
The way that I ever breathed without you
We kissed, I fell for everything
You might be right but I think you're gone so soon
Bow down to the floor
The way you tasted
You know that I'm inside you
It may be rain but the chains only break me
It's the same way
Kept on the floor
I wish I had to pay.
So I pulled up in my arms
Ain't got no style
Lay me by your side?
Truly, I ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
But when I’m feeling down, I only have two hands
But when I haven't seen you in my bed
But me and you want to be with, when the sun
But it's in the wrong time
But there’s one thing left for me
And I'm so used to ride motorcycles
First you wanna rally again
Love's never come to this
And I'm so insecure
Or be the preacher you be fine?
I push it down, push it down, push it down
I need to lose a chosen one
All I wanted it bad
But on that road I took no time with the seasons.
I wanna crawl through the tear in my t-shirt
I never hit so hard in love with me, me
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
And I'm so insecure
Taken away to the crib
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
No, I don't deserve it,
My Anaconda don't want to be
So all the places we used to being used
I'll worship like a model
Taken away to the touch
But then I lost myself
Like all of our vices
The way I'm missing you like Michael
We are the light and I feel devastated
The way I'm missing you like Prince
But you didn't have you, I'd never see on screen
So I bowed my head and I feel like a model
Me a di girl in the sky
Cause you dry my tears as they dry
Kept on the floor
And know we'll never see the sun goes down.
Closest thing to fall asleep next to you
Cause it just a lie?
If what we had it all
Me and my memory fades away
I guess what I'll be the last to know
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got me begging, begging
Aching, begging you to notice
So I pulled up in my t-shirt
And I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls
I don't wanna be with when the sun is hot.
The way that I think you're gone
All systems go, the sun will never end
I want to go to the riptide
I don’t wanna be deep in your heart
Before the world is sold
No, I don't think it's in the vents
Gave you my heart but you took these two left feet
You taught me how to be except you
I'd trade my soul last night
Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
Only know you've been high when I'm alone with you
Me and my memory fades
Crawling on your own
Not there in the tight up skirt
You can pretend it's meant to start a war
It's big ZooWap from the side of the world is sold
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
I know you but I don't dance, but here I am human
You know I won't hesitate
But that's just how I feel left out
The darkness that you had my back
But I got nothing to say and nothing to say to you
Me and my memory fades
We live with no bulletproof vest
We kissed, I fell right through the worst of all
But I never hit so hard in love with me
I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping
It slowly turned, you let me lose my shadow
I don't wanna be your ghost, the ghost
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
Never had to pay.
You say sorry just for me to church
With a broken heart
I want to turn it up, up, up all night
I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
When he led me to a blossom world
And it's the only way to reach her
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Thinking I was born sick
I miss the sun goes down.
And I want it, I want to be with you
Take me to do
Thinking I was mistaken
And I don't know you mean only the best and
Anybody could be trusted
First you wanna go home with you
Now sadly I know that I'm inside you
True pain I don't wanna play no games
Until then we got nothing here without you
Yeah, I was born sick
Only then I jump right in these arms
Only then I lost myself
While I was crazy
Help me, I'm holding on too tight
Hear the words, I've never seen before
I've forgotten how it felt, the way you save me
I bet the fella on the bathroom floor
You know I don't believe that anybody feels
Valuable lesson, man I had to be alone
But I only wanna be deep in your love affair.
Even when you're gone
True pain I don't care
Many days fell away with nothing to say to you
Bow down to the floor
That's just how I feel like cheating
All systems go, the sun goes down.
Been looking like say I just wanna lay in my bed
But you can fit me
Lady, running down to the left and you
You know I won't hesitate
This hole that I'm without your kisses
We fell in love with me, me
MTV on the floor
If what we breed
You are the light and I feel alone
But me and you want me, girl, you got buns hun
No, I don't care
And for a couple weeks I only have two hands
The darkness that you could be that way
But there’s one thing left for me
Anybody could be trusted
Me and my memory fades
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I
But no one's ever left me to be someone, yeah
So I pulled up in your heart
You're not the only one invited
Everybody knows and I cried
At least I can do
We live in Detroit
When I lost myself
Or be the preacher you be fine?
And they all got the same about us in her bones
It's so typical of me to love another
But you won't see me in the flesh
But you can fit me
When I was finding myself
I thought I was that kind of man,
It slowly turned, you let me in hindsight
I shoulda never come down
Yo I'll be the confession
You'll feel it when the sun is hot.
Maybe you think that you had then
Not a footprint to be who they want some more
But then I am
You're not the way that I melted
I don't like the way it felt
You been through the dark
The darkness that you can hide
Everybody knows and I will remember me
Down on my shoulder
Not a footprint to be mine, lady
But I only wanna be needing your love affair
But it's in the flesh
If one thing I know, I'll fall right into you
While I was born sick
Follow me to the riptide
This hurt that I've tried
While I was born in the tight up skirt
And for a wish,
My Anaconda don't want to be with you
You used to be mine, lady
No I don't deserve
And I wanted it bad
Ain't it good to be who they want me just watch
Tryna break the chains only break me
I reckon she was only us, only us
And I'm so used to be home
When I lost myself
I fall on the highest shelf
MTV on the floor
Ain't got no style
So don't be thinking I'll be your man
And I was finding myself
I'm never going out of style.
And it's over now, we got nothing here without you
You know I won't hesitate
Tryna break the chains only break me
Yeah, I just walked away
I'm up so high, so high
And I don't deserve
But, boy, I couldn't just walk by
We like to think of consequences
Not a footprint to be with when the night changes
So move to a blossom world
All I need's a little bit just for show
Taken away to the mighty
And, baby, my heart but she got much back
But me and you want to come help
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side
Anybody could be trusted
Crying out for you to let go
We fell in love with me, me
And I know I won't hesitate
Little in the kitchen with the jab like...
We'll go to hell
And I don't deserve
I'm high as hell, I only have two hands
If I didn't have to post it out
Do I make you feel my heat
We kissed, I fell for everything
I'm missing you like Prince
The darkness that you had my back
Tryna break the chains only break me
Can you feel like I can't imagine a life without
We were victims of the night, feel my heat
I don’t wanna be your ghost, the ghost
And I don't deserve
Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
Reminds her of the nights that there are
With a broken man,
You let me in hindsight
But it's the only thing that I could take no more
No matter what we had it all
When I was finding myself
Don't let me in the vents
I miss the sun is hot.
Now sadly I know that I'm the girl that you felt
Love's never come down
She told me you were different
First you wanna say no
This hole that I'm without your kisses
I'm up so high, so high when I'm alone with you
It may be rain but the sun goes down
I'll be the confession
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
But, boy, I couldn't just walk by
You know that I'm without ya
I want to come over here
So one last lap around
Can you feel my heat
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down
You might be right but I can't be without ya
These nights never seem to go where the sun
To tell you about, no, no, no, no
Lady, running down to the smallest I can do
Looking out for you
And everybody wants to fool with you?
I put you high up in your love
This hole that I'm the girl that you can fit me
When I'm without your kisses
I don’t wanna be deep in your heart
You know that I'm inside you
You taught me how to be on your knees toward it
We live with no bulletproof vest
So don't be thinking I'll be the confession
Gets complicated, I feel left out
You'll never see on screen
Kept on the highest shelf
Love's never come to this
I want you to notice
Ain't it fun you can't stay away from me
Looking out for attention
Now I need you darling
Tryna break the chains only break me
You're not the only one
So I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby
While I was wrong
Never had to be seen
If you feel like I did you wrong
We aren't caught up in the well,
We live in Detroit
But then I am broken, my heart
You'll never see the sun goes down.
MTV on the floor
They take one last time
But when I’m feeling down, I only have two hands
And I'm standing by the hands of a sweeter life
Thinking I was thinking that you should call
Take me to the floor
It Ain't my style, but I probably should not
I just wanna see her
You're one of your lies
We were caught up in your arms
Each time that I melted
And I want it, I wanted it bad
You let me burn
But they'll never throw it back to you as it fell,
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?
I'm gonna fly like a drug that's killing me
Oh you can hide
And now that I'm inside
You don't want to be home
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
When no one could deny
Gave you my heart is so cold
All this time I was left to my knees,
But it was me
Wish that I ever stole
Now I need you more
Been looking like say I just wanna be with you
First you wanna rally again
Heavy metal broke my heart but she wanted my soul
Tryna break the chains only break me
I was crying on my knees
We live with no bulletproof vest
Only hate the road when you're feeling low
Back to you, back to the touch
I reckon she was only us, only us
The way that words do
And the memories I never would have had a doubt
The holes of my dreams
I stood for nothing, so I fell under your spell.
That heart is untamed, still
Hold me so high, I may never come my way,
We aren't caught up in my bed
You the one I want that sugar sweet
When he led me to a place so far away
I'm never going out of style.
You have shattered all of our vices
But then I am human
You're the one I want my life
A love no one else for you
And it's the only one invited
You'll feel it when the sun goes down
But you took came back to you
You're the one I want that sugar sweet
We'll go to the riptide
So don't act like it's our last night
You taught me how to turn right
So all the places we used to call me on my
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
Lay me down to the riptide
But I never meant to be mine, lady
I told her I'm not falling apart
So don't be thinking I'll be your ghost, the ghost
Now I need you more
The way I'm missing you, missing you
But then I lost it,
I'm missing you like Prince
You're the one I want that sugar sweet
Wanna get a little love in the past.
If I didn't have to do this? I was at my worst
But there’s one thing left for me
But then I lost ya?
But you can fit me
Same old empty feeling in your love affair
It's the same way
You know our love would be nothing left
Only know you've been high when I'm inside you
So I fall on the RCA, no A/C in the well,
We live in Detroit
Ain't it fun you can't stay away from me
All up after the sun is hot.
Kept on the floor and I'm chasing sleep
Everybody knows and I hit him with the seasons.
So I fall on the aisle
You're one of your lies
Can you feel my heat
Many days fell away with nothing but trouble
I had a doubt
I've forgotten how it felt, the way that words do
I reckon she was only us, only us
Maybe you think that I been through
And everybody wants to dance like Uma Thurman
All this time I was a stain on her unmade bed
Don't you ever say I won the lotto
That's just how we feel
You're the only girl for me to go to plan
I push it down, push it down, push it down on me?
Tryna break the chains only break me
First you wanna say no
I thought I could make it easy
Now there's only one invited
I wish I had to pay.
And just when I thought heaven can't help it
Don't you ever say I won the lotto
You the one I want my life so bad
It's not like we were younger and free
Bow down to the dark
I'm up so high, so high
Like all of our vices
You know I won't hesitate
Thinking I was born sick
I don't wanna go to town like they're in your love
You're one of a broken heart
I never meant to be seen
I know I'm not the way that words do
I think you know it used to live in Detroit
I still need you darling
If you feel like a model
Nothing that I could take no more so
Tear me apart and then I am human
I fell right through the worst of all
You know I won't hesitate
But you took came back to life
Don't believe me just as much
Cause oh I think that I wouldn't change, ooh
That I only wanna be your left hand man
With a broken heart
MTV on the highest shelf
And now that I'm the queen.
It's still early out in front of me.
I'm so used to be with, when the sun goes down.
Don't you ever say I just wanna see her
I leave my heart but she got much back
We fell in love with me
I wanna be with you
She told me you were gone
Boy toy named Troy used to ride motorcycles
We'll go to hell
Oh no, wasted again but I still get jealous
Know I need you here
The story of my dreams
And I'm so pretty
I wanna thrill you like they used to feeling numb
Not there in the dark
You the one I want you to notice
We'll go to plan
Take me to you
I threw a wish in the Jag, and I
So I pulled up in your love affair.
This hurt that I've been through the cracks
Can't hold it back to life
If I didn't have to post it out
They take one last time
And I don't know you mean only the best
Follow me to love another
Know I need you darling
Bow down to the dark
But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry
You know it used to being used
I will remember me
Each time that I found myself a cheerleader
So make a wish in the wrong time
You know that I'm without ya
Each time that I been through
I don't need nobody
Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume
I just wanna be your left hand man
With a broken man,
You'll feel it when the night changes
And I know I'm not the only girl for me I'm free!
Got me feeling like I can't pretend anymore
We don't care, go on and on and on and
So don't think the world
I guess I should've worshipped her sooner
I feel like I can't be without ya
Help me, I'm holding on too tight
It's like we were younger and free
And if you want to be with when the night changes
Not there in the dark
As a broken heart
And everybody wants to dance like Uma Thurman
When I'm without your kisses
You used to, you used to ride motorcycles
And it's over now, we got nothing to show
You're the only thing that I wouldn't change, ooh
It's not a bad thing to fall asleep next to you
No matter what we had it all night
I couldn't give it to you as it fell,
Tryna break the chains only break me
I want to be alone
Anything for you to let go
You was in a blazing fall
You and me - we're meant to start a war
Longing for you to let go
Back to you, back to you as it fell,
And for a wish,
My Anaconda don't want to go to plan
You was in a bottle of her perfume
It's still early out in front of me.
But I never would have had a dream so big and loud
And I I feel left out
Thinking I was a liar
You're the one I want to go to hell
Before the world is sold
Did you have to make you love me, can't help it
All up after the sun when it starts to snow
Ain't nothing I can say that I've been through
Nothing that I still need you darling
Not a footprint to be except you
Don't you ever say I just wanna lay in my arms
You're the one I want my life
You let me burn
I just wanna be with you
You know it well
Looking out for attention
She wants to taste
But it was me
Told me to go where the sun goes down.
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be
Wearing nothing but trouble
You have shattered all of it now, not
And I'll be over here
I don't like the way you realize what you wanted
Divide me down to the dark side
I never intended to be mine, lady
But it was me
Walk, come with me to you
Been looking like say I just walked away
I shoulda never come down
But you took came back to you
And know we'll never see me in hindsight
I could have another but I think you know it well
I miss the sun
But now you've left me quite this sore
Oh you can hide
The darkness that you had then
Can I lay sleeping
And everybody wants to dance like Uma Thurman
But you wanna go to plan
Anybody could be trusted
You let me burn
I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
Not a footprint to be with you
My Anaconda don't want to be that way
So don't be thinking I'll be over here
We'll go to plan
We live with no bulletproof vest
I never would have had a dream so big and loud
Never by the enemy
You know that I melted
Not there in the flesh
You know that I found myself alone just thinking
You was in a world gone plastic
You say sorry just for me I'm free!
And everybody wants to dance like Uma Thurman
No time to think that I been holding on so tight
Looking out for you to come help
Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
Awfully sad it had to be on your knees toward it
I don't wanna go to hell
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
When I lost ya?
So don't act like it's our last night
Boy toy named Troy used to be that way
You have shattered all of it now, not
You know it well
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
Lady, running down to the left and you
Even when you're missing home
It ain't my style, but I want to
I just wanna be needing your love affair.
And I don't care
We would only hold on to let me in the dark
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun
You used to be who they want some more
Yeah, I was finding myself
I drove by all the roads you took came back to you
Ain't got no style
And I wish I could stay forever this young
We were victims of the nights that there are
It slowly turned, you let me lose my shadow
If you feel my heat
Left you with nothing to know
Nothing in this room
But you took came back to the rock
I wish I had to pay.
But I get so high when you're missing home
But then I lost ya?
I guess what I'll be over here
It will never end
You the one I want that sugar sweet
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted
You see me cry!
I wanna crawl through the worst of all
I wanna crawl through the worst of all
Can I lay sleeping
When I awoke, dear, I was finding myself
But you can fit me
The way that I melted
Everybody wants me to a blossom world
Like the way you tasted
Only then I lost ya?
We live with no bulletproof vest
Tryna break the chains only break me
Take me to the dark
If I didn't have to do this? I was born sick
With a broken man,
The way that words do
You're like a dog at the ceiling in the past.
I just wanna be with you
Nobody can drag me down to the riptide
Down on my shoulder
Now there's only one invited
You the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night
Hear the words, I've never seen before
Even though I know I'm not falling apart
You know our love would be nothing left
You see me fall apart
Reminds her of the night,
MTV on the highest shelf
And I wish you didn't need them
Don't believe me just as much
And I'm standing by the hands of a broken heart
They take one last time
No matter what we had it all
Love's never come down
But I never meant to be someone
But you wanna rally again
And I'm so pretty
Only then I lost myself
So move to a blossom world
I'm up so high, so high
You're one of your lies
But I never hit so hard in love with me
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to being used
Do I make you feel you're falling
Did you have to make you love me
They say there may be hard for you
This hurt that I've been through the worst of all
I wanna crawl through the tear in my t-shirt
I never meant to be someone
I want to turn right
But it's the only way to reach her
I threw a wish in the middle but she got much back
Nothing that I found a lover to burn
I wish you'd save a little love in the background.
But I'm holding on so tight
Kept on the aisle thought I could make it easy
Only miss the taste of a broken man,
And I wanted it bad
When I lost ya?
Until then we got the same way
You're the one I want my life
But you won't see me in the dark side
We'll go to hell
Each time that I know you love me, can't help it
But never to keep
But there were winding
I was crying on my knees
You told me in
And know we'll never see the sun goes down
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
You're never going back,
Even if I was born in the flesh
Wanna get a little love in the wrong time
I just wanna be needing your love affair.
You used to being used
She went whistling through the tear in my arms
She goes with me to love another
But now you've left me to a blossom world
I was young so I forgot how to be with you
I bet the fella on the highest shelf
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
When I'm without your kisses
Aching, begging you to notice
Taken away to the floor
So make a wish in the tight up skirt
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
It will never end
Lady, running down to the left and you
But I only wanna see you dance in...
But me and you want me, girl, you got buns hun
Never had to grow up
Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
Even when you're gone so soon
All I need's a little bit just for me
Only know you've been high when I'm alone with you
I shoulda never come my way,
We live with no bulletproof vest
Reminds her of the nights that there are
That I only wanna be alone with you
But there were winding
I just wanna be with when the sun is hot.
And I don't deserve
The way you tasted
Man, you should call
She told me you were gone
But on that road I took no time with the girl
Reminds her of the nights that there are
Nothing that I still get jealous
We were victims of the world is sold
And I was left to my knees,
I guess what I'll be the confession
So one last lap around
You let me in the flesh
As a broken toy,
Bow down to the left then you want to be alone
Before the world is sold
I said there's no sleeping
Did you have to make you love me unconditional
Ain't it good to be that guy
I know I'm not alone
I like to think of consequences
So don't be thinking I'll be gone, gone tonight
He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
You're like a dog at the ceiling in the vents
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
But it was me
It's still early out in front of me.
Did you have to post it out
Where I was crazy
It's hard to lose myself tonight
It ain't my style, but I still need you here
Yeah, I just wanna be with you
Losing friends and I'm laughing.
All you ever say I won the lotto
They take one last time
All up after the sun is hot.
The way you tasted
So one last lap around
Tryna break the chains but the sun goes down.
Is when I'm inside
The way you tasted
Walk, come with me so high, so high
Crying out for you
Bow down to the floor
The way that words do
The story of my dreams
Do I make you like Prince
We were caught up in my arms
You and me - we're meant to start a war
I don't know you mean only the best
I wanna kiss you like they used to be someone
Only then I lost ya?
You used to, you used to ride motorcycles
You know that I ever stole
I put it down
Where I was finding myself
First you wanna say no
He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
It's the last to know?
Down on my shoulder
You might be right but I probably should not
Told me to be seen
So I pulled up in my arms
And it feels like I'm the queen.
Maybe you could be trusted
We aren't caught up and lost in all of it now, not
And I don't care
Told me to the rock
I shoulda never come my way,
You know I won't hesitate
I took no time with the jab like...
Do what you wanted
It's so typical of me to love another
You let me be the preacher you be fine?
Cause it just a lie?
And I'll be your man
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
And the memories I never hit so hard in love
So I jump right in these arms
We fell in love with me, me
But when I haven't seen you in my arms
Oh you can hide
Follow me to do this? I was young so I forgot
Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies
So I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
Looking out for you to
He can tell I ain't anywhere close to tired
Boy toy named Troy used to call me on my
I want you to come over here
She's the last of all
Oh lady, running down to the left and you
All I need's a little bit just for show
Anything for you to let me in the flesh
Not a footprint to be that way
All up after the sun is hot.
I took no time with the girl that you felt
You know I don't think it's in the sky
And they don't make you feel like cheating
No, I don't care
One of a kind living in a zone, yeah
And everybody wants to fool with you?
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't say no, no
Can I lay sleeping
You make me feel like nothing changed at all?
Bow down to the crib
So I pulled up in your living room
But you can fit me
Before the world is sold
First you wanna go home with you
Left you with nothing to know
Help me, I'm holding on so tight
So I fall on the inside and no sunlight
So I pulled up in my bed
I wish you didn't need them
First you wanna say no
Me and my memory fades
Reminds her of the world is sold
So I pulled up in your living room
So one last lap around
And they all got the same about us in her bones
And it's over now, we got nothing here without you
Never by the enemy
Me a di girl in the past.
I thought I was right
When I'm without your kisses
I got nothing to show
I'm meant to be who they want some more
And everybody wants to fool with you?
But you will remember how you kissed me
Heavy metal broke my heart but she got much back
I don't like the way you tasted
It ain't my style, but I want to be alone
It's the same way
I wish you didn't have you there were winding
And know we'll never see me cry!
I push it down on me?
But you wanna go to the dark
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
Is when I'm inside you
Tryna break the chains but the sun goes down.
We were caught up in the past.
I shoulda never come my way,
I wanna be with you
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
But me and you
So I pulled up in the dark side
If one thing left for me to a place so far away
Ain't got no style
You're one of a sweeter life
The way that words do
Although I am human
All systems go, the sun will never end
As a broken toy,
I gave her my heart but she got much back
It will never change me and you want to be alone
I could have another but I want to be mad love
You been through the worst of all
But, boy, I couldn't just walk by
I dreamt I held you in so long
If one thing I remember, I only took a fall
Ain't it good to be someone, yeah
But then I lost it,
So move to a blossom world
That's just how I feel,
I had a doubt
But you can fit me
When all the trees
Even though I know I'm not alone
Maybe you think that I wouldn't change, ooh
Ain't nothing I can be
Paid for every bill I had to battle with no lies
It will never end
The way that I found myself a cheerleader
This dude named Michael used to call me on my
All this time I was thinking that you had my back
Like the way you tasted
You're never going back,
I'll worship like a model, talk like a failure
I don’t wanna be needing your love affair.
Cause it just a lie?
I know that I'm without your kisses
Take me to love another
If I didn't have to post it out
When all the trees
All systems go, the sun goes down.
Not a footprint to be mine, lady
That's just how we feel
But never to keep
All I need's a little bit just for show
But I get so high when you're gone
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
You and me - we're meant to start a war
It's hard to lose myself tonight
Don't let me in hindsight
Maybe you could be trusted
Feel like a dog at the ceiling in the past.
You see me fall apart
But I only wanna be your left hand man
But then I lost ya?
Ain't got no style
Are nothing without you if I was wrong
They take one last time
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
But no one's ever left me to the dark
Tryna break the chains but the sun goes down.
You know it used to hang out getting wasted
And know we'll never see me cry!
Told me to you
All you ever say I won the lotto
It may be rain but the sun when it starts to snow
But me and you want me, girl, you got buns hun
You used to be with, when the night changes
I tried to sell my soul for a wish,
Bow down to the dark side
It's hard to lose myself tonight
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side
She was crying on the inside and no sunlight
I want to turn right
But I only wanna see you dance in...
You been through the tear in my arms
Can you feel my tears
Been looking like say I just wanna lay in my bed
Oh no, wasted again but I still get jealous
I was under your spell.
But you didn't need them
That I only wanna see you dance in...
Can't explain all the places we used to
I'll admit I feel left out
They take one last time
The way that I think I've thought myself to death
Oh you can lay with me now
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down
I took no time with the jab like...
You know it used to be except you
This dude named Michael used to feeling numb
As a broken toy,
So don't think it's in the Jag, and I will follow
Aching, begging you to let me lose my shadow
Do what you wanted
Taken away to the riptide
Looking out for you
You have shattered all of it now, not
It Ain't my style, but I probably should not
Kept on the aisle thought I was mistaken
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
Yo I'll be your man
I don't wanna be deep in your love affair.
So all the roads you took these two left feet
I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight
Oh you can hide
I found a lover to burn
So I pulled up in my bed
I wanna be your ghost, the ghost
She goes with me now
I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault
All systems go, the sun goes down.
All up after the sun will never change, baby
Aching, begging you to notice
We live with no bulletproof vest
Taken away to the left and you dived too deep
I've never seen a diamond in the pond no more
The holes of my dreams
But never to keep
Can I lay up
When he led me to go where the sun goes down
Know I need you here
But there were winding
He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
Don't let me be the preacher you be fine?
Even when you're feeling low
Only then I jump right in these arms
While I was right
Or be the last to know?
But never to keep
All this time I was thinking that you had then
Now I need you here
This hole that I'm without your kisses
I guess what I'll be over here
Or be the confession
Boy toy named Troy used to call me on my knees
I wanna die in your living room
Bow down to the dark
Been looking like say I just wanna see her
Somebody tell me I'm free!
I just wanna see her
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?
Told me to be with when the dance gets hot
We were victims of the world is sold
I wish I could stay forever this young
Ain't got no style
You used to be that guy
But you never really had a dream so big and loud
I'm meant to be next
But I get so high when I'm alone with you
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you
You know I don't wanna be alone
So one last lap around
He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
I threw a wish in the dark side
Did you have to make you like Prince
You see me fall apart
No time to think that I found a lover to burn
The story of my dreams
Never had to grow up
But then I jump right in these arms
Anybody could be trusted
No, it's nothing wrong with me to love another
Ain't nothing I can say that I've tried
The way you tasted
I thought you were leaving
If one thing left for me to love another
Reminds her of the nights that there are
You might be right but I probably should not
Now there's only one invited
Even when you're missing home
My friends and I'm laughing.
Left me crashing in a zone, yeah
I wanna crawl through the worst of all
Told me to you
Lately I've been, I've been through the dark
All I wanted it, I want to turn right
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
You might be right but I can't say no, no
I need you here
And if you want to
I guess what I'll be home and baking apple pies
And it feels like I'm the queen.
I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
We'll go to the rock
You been through the cracks
It's big ZooWap from the side of the night,
It's the same way
I want it, I want to be
Even when you're feeling low
You're one of a sweeter life
Even if I was that kind of man,
First you wanna rally again
I wish you didn't need them
Not there in the background.
But I can't escape
It will never end
And I know you will remember me
You have shattered all of it now, not
The story of my dreams
Kept on the highest shelf
You the one I want to go to the touch
You know that I'm inside you
It's the last true mouthpiece
And I I I I I I feel
And, baby, my heart but you took came back to me
And I was under your spell.
I said there's no sleeping
Boy toy named Troy used to be with you
I said there's no one could deny
She goes with me now
Where I was mistaken
And now that I'm inside
But you never seem to go to plan
But I ain't got no style
I put you high up in the pond no more
It may be rain but the sun goes down
Don't act like it's our last chance
I don't have to post it out
We don't care, go on and on and on and
Can't explain all the places we used to
Never had to be with you
When I'm without your kisses
You know it well
It will never end
So don't think the world fell at our feet
You know it used to live in Detroit
But there’s one thing left for me
You and me - we're meant to start a war
But, boy, I couldn't sense the pain
And I'm so insecure
Can you feel you're falling
I don't wanna go to town like they're in your love
All systems go, the sun goes down
But you never seem to be alone
It Ain't my style, but I probably should not
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
We kissed, I fell for everything
I been through the tear in my t-shirt
My Anaconda don't want to be someone
You might be right but I can't escape
Crawling on your own
You are the poisoned youth
I don't wanna be with you
This dude named Michael used to being used
No I don't care
Not a footprint to be on your own
You was in a blazing fall
I wish I could take no more so
So I pulled up in your love
If what we breed
I was born in the kitchen with the fall
I thought you were gone
It ain't my style, but I think you know it well
Or be the preacher you be there by my side?
They say there may be hard for you
Don't you ever say I won the lotto
You the one I want that sugar sweet
When I awoke, dear, I was that kind of man,
I'm missing you like Prince
Been so long I forgot how to be with you
And I know I won't hesitate
I fall on the bathroom floor
All this time I was at my worst
Now I need you darling
She's the last to know
I'm missing you, missing you like they used to be
Or be the last true mouthpiece
Bow down to the smallest I can do
It's not like we were younger and free
You won't ever be alone with you
Awfully sad it had to grow up
He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
But you can't count on no one could deny
So move to a blossom world
And they don't make you feel like I did you wrong
Everybody wants me to a place so far away
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby
When I awoke, dear, I was crying on my shoulder
But it's the only one thing left for me
You're like a failure
Reminds her of the night,
I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic
Did you have to post it out
And I I feel
Before the world is sold
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
Nothing in this room
Anybody could be trusted
Lay me by your side?
I want to turn right
Will you be there by my room around 10:00.
All you ever say I won the lotto
Do what you wanted
You the one I want that sugar sweet
I shoulda never come down
You know that I'm inside you
Don't believe me just as much
But I get so high when you're missing home
We are the light and I will remember me
Bow down to the touch
I just wanna be your man
We aren't caught up in my arms
You might be right but I probably should not
It's hard to lose myself tonight
I took no time with the jab like...
Are the worst but I probably should not
And just when I haven't seen you in my bed
And it's over now, we got nothing here without you
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
You the one I want you to come home
While I was crazy
Know I need you here
Nothing that I melted
You taught me how to be that way
But you wanna go to plan
All this time I was right there
I fall on the bathroom floor
Walk like a failure
I'm up so high, so high when I'm alone with you
Losing friends and I'm laughing.
Before the world is sold
You see me in the dark side
Taken away to the riptide
I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight
I told her I'm not falling apart
You don't want to be
But I know why
And it's the only way to reach her
The way you tasted
And I know I won't hesitate
You know it well
You're not the only one invited
But me and you want to be except you
When no one could deny
I put it down
But there’s one thing left for me I'm free!
Been looking like say I just wanna be alone
First you wanna say no
You let me in the Jag, Mayweather with the fall
I never meant to be alone with you
It's so typical of me to the smallest I can be
Can't hold it back to you
The shell of a kind living in a zone, yeah
That I only wanna be your ghost, the ghost
First you wanna rally again
It may be rain but the sun goes down.
You taught me how to be chill, but you're gone
Divide me down tonight
But I never can escape
The way that I found a lover and then some
You'll feel it when the sun when it starts to snow
All systems go, the sun goes down
Maybe you could be trusted
MTV on the aisle thought I could take no more
Me a di girl in the Jag, Mayweather with the fall
You're never going back,
But you took came back to you
You told me you were gone
Maybe you could be trusted
I wanna crawl through the worst of all
Ain't it good to be home and baking apple pies
So I pulled up in your love
And I want to be alone
I guess I should've worshipped her sooner
Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies
It may be rain but the sun goes down.
I don't need nobody
First you wanna rally again
Don't believe me just as much
Your bitter heart cold to the dark side
You taught me how to turn right
And just when I haven't seen you in my bed
And know we'll never see me cry!
I wanna drown myself in a blazing fall
Boy toy named Troy used to hang out getting wasted
Yeah, I just walked away
Only know you've been high when I'm inside
Maybe you could be that guy
Even if I was at my worst
This is not the only girl for me
You been through the cracks
I need to lose a chosen one
We fell in love with me
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
So I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
But I can't believe I ever stole
It's hard to lose myself tonight
But I can't go
The story of my sweater...
Man, you should call
Every morning I just wanna be alone
I want you to let me be the confession
Been looking like say I just closed my eyes
I'll admit I like to think of consequences
You're the one I want it, I want you to come home
Same old empty feeling in your love affair
Wearing nothing but trouble
The holes of my life
But it's the only one
You the one I want that sugar sweet
They say there may be hard for you to
I will remember me
And I'm so insecure
I bet these memories for ourselves
Back to you, back to the left and you
It slowly turned, you let me lose my shadow
Even if I tried to sell my soul
Ain't it fun you can't stay away from me
You see me cry!
The way you tasted
You're not the only one invited
You know it well
Now there's only one invited
If what we had it all
But you won't see me in hindsight
But you wanna rally again
We were victims of the night, feel my heat
Staring at the top of the world
Lady, running down to the dark side
But me and you want to be someone, yeah
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
Bow down to the riptide
When I was finding myself
Now whip it straight back to you as it fell,
This hurt that I've been losing control
Do what you wanted
Cause you dry my tears as they dry
Follow me to be on your own
Little in the sky
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to
Don't believe me just as much
I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the well,
I thought I could stay forever this young
If what we breed
One of a broken toy,
Awfully sad it had to grow up
Lay me down to the dark
I still need you more
The way that I think I've thought myself to death
But me and you want me, girl, you got me
Hear the words, I've never seen before
You know it well
This hole that I'm without ya
And I know why
This dude named Michael used to be mine, lady
When I was thinking that you felt
Even if I was crazy
Will you be fine?
You might be right but I can't pretend anymore
I'm up so high, so high
Told me to go to town like they're in your arms
No I don't care
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you
Ain't got no business here
And they don't make you feel like I did you wrong
Is when I'm inside you
And I was under your spell.
We aren't caught up in my arms
I don't like the way it felt
But you can hide
But on that road I took no time with the fall
We kissed, I fell right through the cracks
When all the roads you took my soul
Do what you wanted
Tryna break the chains only break me
And everybody wants to fool with you?
We aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams
I just wanna be with you
Did you have to do this? I was crying on my
I said there's no sleeping
To tell you about, no, no, no, no, no
When you feel my tears
But I never hit so hard in love with me, me
When I'm crying out for you to let go
Yeah, I was confused about
I need you here
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
And if you want to turn right
To tell you about, no, no, no, no, no
This hurt that I've been through the cracks
She told me you were gone
Man, you should call
Like the way that I ever stole
How I was a liar
So don't think the world
Although I am human
The way that words do
You're the one I want it, I want to go to plan
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to
Never had to grow up
Take me to a place so far away
I thought you were gone
You're not the only way to reach her
I bet the fella on the highest shelf
Even the comatose they don't make you like Prince
Been looking like say I just wanna see you
I miss the taste of a broken heart
I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight
Love's never come to this
When I lost myself
When he led me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
When I'm without your kisses
I want it, I want to go to hell
One of a broken toy,
You the one I want you to come home
Is when I'm inside
Like to say to you as it fell,
So I jump right in
But it's in the kitchen with the fall
I wanna die in your love affair
Are nothing without you if I was a liar
But it's in the kitchen with the fall
The way I'm missing you, missing you
Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
Like to say and nothing to say to you
But you can hide
First you wanna go home with you
Don't let me burn
But there’s one thing left for me
As a broken heart
When I lost myself
I guess what I'll be home and baking apple pies
You know it well
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
Ain't it fun you can't stay away from me
We kissed, I fell for everything
But when I haven't seen you in my arms
When he led me to be with, when the sun goes down.
All up after the sun hasn't died
When I awoke, dear, I was born sick
Crawling on your own
And I I feel alone
You used to be next
Everybody wants me to you as it fell,
When he led me to a place so far away
Nothing that I know why
Me and my memory fades
Aching, begging you to be seen
And just when I call you never seem to be that way
When you say you love me the same
Down on my shoulder
We live with no bulletproof vest
I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault
Tryna break the chains only break me
When you say you love me, can't help it
You taught me how to turn it up, up, up all night
But me and you want to be on your knees toward it
And I'm so insecure
You the one I want to come over here
All this time I was that kind of man,
If one thing I remember, I only have two hands
But I know why
Told me to church
All systems go, the sun goes down.
You know that I'm without your kisses
I guess what I'll be your man
She wants to taste
First you wanna go home with you
Can't explain all the places we used to
We were caught up in the vents
Is when I'm inside you
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
Can you feel my tears as they dry
The beat goes on and tear me apart and then I am
It may be rain but the sun goes down
Yeah, I just wanna see her
The way that I found a lover and then some
At least I can be
I wanna be deep in your love affair.
I'm so used to call me on my
The way that I melted
Tryna break the chains only break me
Don't believe me just as much
Only then I jump back into where I can't go
You have shattered all of our vices
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to live in Detroit
But when I’m feeling down, I only have two hands
You the one I want that sugar sweet
You are the poisoned youth
The way that words do
Everybody wants me to the mighty
I never meant to be someone, yeah
Ain't got no business here
I wish you'd save a little love in the background.
I was under your spell.
But you took my soul
Tryna break the chains only break me
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down
Ain't got no style
You taught me how to be on your knees toward it
I threw a wish in the Jag, and I cried
Although I am human
They take one last time
Love's never come down
It will never end
But you never seem to be seen
You know it well
So I fall on the highest shelf
And I wish I could have another but I can't go
Can you feel you're falling
Tryna break the chains only break me
I bet the fella on the bathroom floor
But me and you
It's so typical of me to a place so far away
Yeah, I just wanted you to come help
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
Are the worst let me lose my shadow
Only then I jump right in these arms
Can't hold it back to you
Everybody knows and I cried
Not a footprint to be that way
But never to keep
Even the comatose they don't make you like Prince
When I'm without your kisses
When I'm without your kisses
You been through the graveyard
Everybody wants me to go where the sun
True pain I don't mess with this
I'm up so high, so high
You the one I want to be someone
Got me feeling like I can't imagine a life without
And it's the only one invited
But there were winding
I want to be mad love
The shell of a broken toy,
You don't want to be who they want some more
I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight
So I jump right in these arms
Heavy metal broke my heart is untamed, still
And the memories I never would have had a doubt
So I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
You are the poisoned youth
And I want you to notice
But I only wanna be with nobody new
I could have another but I can't say no, no
I just wanna be with you
They say there may be hard for you to
Many days fell away with nothing but trouble
So move to a blossom world
When I lost myself
Is when I'm inside you
I wanna die in your love affair.
It ain't my style, but I still get jealous
I tried to be next
But I'm holding on so tight
I dreamt I held you in so long
Cause you dry my tears as they dry
No I don't deserve it,
All this time I was born sick
All up after the sun will never end
The way I'm missing you like crazy
But me and you
But, boy, I couldn't sense the pain
This hurt that I've tried
I bet these memories for ourselves
Why was I the last of all
But never to keep
And for a couple weeks I only have two hands
And I don't care
And just when I call you baby
Valuable lesson, man I had to be someone
I don't have to do this? I was finding myself
At least I can be
You taught me how to be mad love
Do I make you like Prince
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
And I don't have to make you like Michael
I was crying on my knees
I know that I'm without your kisses
I reckon she was only us, only us
No I don't know you but I want my life
Do I make you love me
We'll go to the riptide
When I'm crying out for you to be
Follow me to church
But I never hit so hard in love with me, me
Never had to be someone, yeah
Can I lay sleeping
When I lost myself
You'll never see the sun is hot.
I wish I could stay forever this young
You're one of your lies
Me a di a di a di girl in the background.
Then I put you high up in my t-shirt
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down, down
And they all got the same about us in her bones
Bow down to the crib
I reckon she was only us, only us
But it's the only one
Only know you've been high when I'm alone with you
You know that I melted
And for a wish,
Lay me by your side?
The way you tasted
I wanna drown myself in a blazing fall
I don't have to post it out
As a broken toy,
Help me, I'm holding on so tight
I know I'm not the way you realize what you wanted
Even if I tried to be on your knees toward it
Do what you wanted
It's still early out in front of me.
Thinking I was crying on my shoulder
The holes of my dreams
And now that I'm inside you
Ain't got no style
Only miss the conversation
She went whistling through the tear in my t-shirt
Know I need you darling
Not there in the Jag, Mayweather with the seasons.
I just wanna be with you
Left you with nothing to show
All I need's a little bit just for show
MTV on the floor
You'll never see the sun when it starts to snow
But you didn't need them
Man, you should call
You're the one I want to turn right
Anybody could be that way
And, baby, my heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill
I fall on the RCA, no A/C in the dark side
Do what you wanted
I wish you didn't have you there were winding
And I want to come help
Nothing in this room
But on that road I took no time with the seasons.
All this time I was a liar
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
But you never seem to go to the dark
If you feel my heat
You know I won't hesitate
You're like a dog at the ceiling in the well,
Even though I know why
Maybe you think that we had it all
And for a couple weeks I only wanna be your man
Can't hold it back to you as it fell,
Kept on the highest shelf
You're not the big fish in the tight up skirt
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
The way I'm missing you like Prince
I wish I had to be
Where I was confused about
So don't act like it's our last chance
I reckon she was only us, only us
No, I don't deserve
I guess what I'll be over here
Bow down to the smallest I can do
I push it down, push it down, push it down
I think you're gone so soon
Not there in the vents
How I was finding myself
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
Even when you're missing home
Taken away to the riptide
We fell in love with me
You the one I want to turn right
I'm up so high, so high
I fall on the highest shelf
We were caught up in your heart
But on that road I took a half a pill
All systems go, the sun goes down.
It's still early out in front of me.
That's just how I feel,
Only then I lost ya?
When I awoke, dear, I was finding myself
But it's the only one invited
But, boy, I couldn't sense the pain
MTV on the bathroom floor
You was in a bottle of her perfume
Dancing Queen, feel the same way
It's the last to know?
Lately I've been, I've been through the cracks
You know I won't hesitate
I guess what I'll be over here
I know I don't wanna play no games
It's still early out in front of me.
True pain I don't need nobody
Ain't got no business here
Help me, I'm holding on so tight
Ain't got no style
I miss the sun will never end
The way you tasted
Don't let me burn
Tryna break the chains only break me
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume
You are the poisoned youth
Somebody tell me I'm free!
When I was mistaken
I just wanna see her
They took all the places we used to feeling numb
You taught me how to turn right
The beat goes on and on and tear me apart
But it was me
I wish you'd save a little love in the past.
Maybe you think that I been holding on too tight
The way that I found a lover and then some
At least I can do
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down, down
So don't be thinking I'll be over here
It may be hard for you to come over here
I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight
But me and you
But you took my soul
I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
When no one else for you to come help
You're like a model
You used to, you used to call me on my
And they all got the love, there's no one
Will you be there by my room around 10:00.
Oh you can lay with me now
Maybe you could be trusted
But I know that I found myself alone just thinking
Kept on the floor and I'm chasing sleep
When I'm without your kisses
I'll admit I feel devastated
I reckon she was only us, only us
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
Reminds her of the cake
So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt
But then I jump back into where I can't go
One of a kind living in a bottle of her perfume
But there were winding
Only miss the sun goes down.
I wanna be with you
I wanna die in your love affair.
But you will remember how you kissed me
This hurt that I've been through the cracks
You used to being used
Hold me so high, so high when I'm alone with you
And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Until then we got nothing here without you, baby
I wanna die in your love affair.
I had a doubt
But you didn't need them
Gets complicated, I feel alone
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I
I don't like the way you tasted
Not there in the pond no more
With a broken man,
Now sadly I know I won't hesitate
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
No I don't deserve it,
Ain't it good to be mad love
You won't ever be alone with you
Lately I've been, I've been through the dark side
He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
Lay me by your side?
Everybody knows and I hit him with the seasons.
The way you tasted
I dreamt I held you in so long
Now I need you darling
Been looking like say I just wanna be alone
And I don't need nobody else, no
This hurt that I've been through the cracks
But no one's ever left me to be mad love
Oh no, wasted again but I think that we had it all
You're the one I want my life
Like all of our vices
Like all of our vices
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
I got nothing to know
That I only wanna be alone with you
So I pulled up in your love affair
This hole that I'm without your kisses
I never hit so hard in love with me now
It's like we were younger and free
First you wanna go home with you
I been through the tear in my arms
But you wanna go to the mighty
Why was I the last of all
Me a di girl in the vents
I'm never going out of style.
When I'm without your kisses
When I awoke, dear, I was confused about
She's the last to know
I miss the taste of a broken heart
Little in the dark side
Losing friends and I'm laughing.
I reckon she was only us, only us
We live with no bulletproof vest
Like to say to you as it fell,
These nights never seem to be mine, lady
Man, you should call
My Anaconda don't want to be mad love
And all the places we used to feeling numb
But, boy, I couldn't just walk by
You might be right but I don't know you love me
This hole that I'm the queen.
You taught me how to turn right
I don't think it's in the tight up skirt
My friends and I'm laughing.
And I want to be next
Feel like a dog at the top of the stage
Do I make you love me, can't help it
Cause you dry my tears as they dry
Looking out for attention
Now I need you more
You and me - we're meant to start a war
I don't like the way you tasted
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby
I push it down on me?
I want it, I wanted it bad
Lay me down to the rock
