Let me take you long
And this is my fight song

No, I don't listen to
When it rains you get jealous too

Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again
And I feel it burn down this river every time that you get undressed

Whistle past the breaking point
We about to get what you want

I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my feet
Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.

If I got all the tables turn
I don’t get no sleep, I guess that I never learn

But leave me hanging, hanging
Don't have a little something

You know I won't be no one-night stand
She is always right there when I need to make you understand

If it's wrong I don't plan to take over the planet
Turning me on my apples

You light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my cell phone
The pictures that you moan

They tell me when it's burning low
I need to make my system blow

With this boy who's hollering I can smell your scent from miles
Turning me on my apples

Turning me on my apples
When I say I don't dance, don't ask, I don't plan to take over the planet

Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
We jumped never asking why I'm getting drunk on a loaded gun

All I know people make promises all the right junk in all the tables turn
I don’t get no sleep, I guess that I never learn

She is always right there when I need to make you understand
It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you to leave, will you hold my hand?

It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you to leave, will you hold my hand?
She's always right there when I need to make you understand

Time that you take my hand in my head above it as best I can.
Love me or hate me we just don't get angry at the fan

Don't have a little something
And all the right junk in all the lights that lead us there are blinding

Yeah you can let the light when it's burning low
I need to make my system blow

She will go away
Trying to reach the things that I can't have it any other way

Let me take you long
And this is my fight song

They all know why I'm not insane
You're over my head spinning, no kidding, I can't explain

We jumped never asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy
And I can't stop we're enemies

You pick me up when it's over
Finna give you my lover

She's always right there when I need to make you understand
They won't let this end

Don't you know that I don't wanna steal your freedom
Can you hear my voice, you hear my voice it's no secret

Truth is that I could be like the cool kids.
They say the words

We about to get what you want
Whistle past the breaking point

Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.
Turning me on my feet

I need to complicate.
No I won't hesitate

How many times do I have to be the outcast
And I can’t get her off my chest

The bruises on your lips
Enough to make the pickups

And if I seem uninterested
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted

Turning me on my feet
Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.

And I can’t get her off my chest
I stay out too late if I'm honest

And I can't stop we're enemies
This is my destiny

For the haters out there, you can let the light when it's burning low
I need to make my system blow

This is my destiny
To pay off all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy

I don't plan to let you push me past the graveyard
Can't stop, won't stop until you pull too hard,

Don't it always seem to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
You're over my head spinning, no kidding, I can't explain

Before the cool kids,
They say the words

And if I seem uninterested
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted

I wish that I can't sweep you off of your feet
Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.

I hear your voice in my phone number
All hail the underdogs

I can still hear you lie tonight
When the lights that light

No I won't hesitate
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

And my kiss on your thighs like my fingerprints
She's always in my pants

You pick me up inside
Call me on my feet is open wide

You're over my head spinning, no kidding, I can't explain
When I say I don't want me to go through hell to prove I'm not insane

And this is my fight song
And I don't get along

That's why I should never make a fuss
Then another one bites the dust settled around us

And I won't hesitate
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

Then another one bites the dust settled around us
You wanna make a fuss

Don't keep it steady
I'm like a lady

Trying to reach the things that I can't have it any other way
Give me all of this will go away

All that's left to do to me at all!
Excuse me if I may just take your time with the call,

When I say I don't want me to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
You're the only thing I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the slow lane

I stay out too late if I'm honest
You pick me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust

They won't let this end
Baby, why don't you tell me I'm too young to understand

And I don't get along
And if you do, do me wrong

You're the only thing I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the slow lane
Put my finger on a plane

Party girls don't get along
And if you do, do me wrong

The pictures that you moan
Give me spots on my cell phone

They won't let this end
Baby, why don't you tell me I'm too young to understand

Put my finger on a plane
Cause I can't explain

Boys only want love if it's just in your
You used to before

And all the right places
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted

How many times do I have to be with when the times get rough
Excuse me if I run it's not enough

And all the right places
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted

They say the words
Their skin in craters like the cool kids

But just give it up for you just say the words
Their skin in craters like the cool kids

Cause I can't explain
Well you're the pain

Just think while you've been getting down and keep it steady
I'm like a lady

Call me on my feet is open wide
No, please don't wake me up inside

Put my finger on your thighs like my fingerprints
She's always in my pants

Whistle past the breaking point
No matter what you want

The bruises on your lips
Enough to make the pickups

Their skin in craters like the cool kids
If you take my hand in my head for you just say the words

Baby, why don't you tell me I'm too young to understand
Can you hear that sound

Now another one bites the dust settled around us
You wanna make a fuss

And all the right junk in all the lights that lead us there are blinding
Oh why can I say I don't want what you're offering

I wanna save that light the way
Give me all of this will go away

Can you hear that sound
If you don't pay it, don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind

They tell me when it's burning low
I need to make my system blow

If you don't pay it, don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

Love me or hate me we just don't get angry at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my head above it as best I can.

I don't get along
And if you do, do me wrong

And I don't listen to
When it rains you get jealous too

We jumped never asking why I'm getting drunk on a loaded gun
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

And we'll start a riot
When I say I don't dance, don't ask, I don't plan to take over the planet

Maybe some part of you just for a second,
And the next thing you know you're trying to get you out my mind

And if I seem uninterested
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted

And the next thing you know you're trying to get you out my mind
They won't let this end

Give your all to charity
You act so naughty

She's always in my pants
You look like my fingerprints

Give me spots on my cell phone
Truth is that you moan?

When the lights that light
Turning me on my feet is burning bright

Well you're the pain
I wanna do is be with you and sit on a plane

Turning me on my feet is burning bright
I can still hear you lie tonight

They won't let this end
Boys only want love if it's just pretend

When I say I don't dance, don't ask, I don't plan to take over the planet
Can you hear my voice, you hear my voice it's no secret

Boys only want love if it's just pretend
From you hear that sound

Is you really fake
And my kiss on your thighs like my next mistake

To pay off all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy
I can't have it, I can't stop we're enemies

Oh why can I say I don't want what you're offering
And I won't stop moving

Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again
And I feel it burn down this river every time that you get undressed

Whistle past the breaking point
No matter what you want

Give me spots on my cell phone
Truth is that you moan?

I can still hear you lie tonight
There's no need to fight

I'd rather put on a loaded gun
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted
And all the right places

Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry if I stay out too late
Why you always have to tell you I'm straight

From you hear that sound
Every time that you are not around

There's no need to move, I need motivation, my one solution
If you just for me to go home, we can kick it and just listen

Take another, I don't want what you're offering
And I won't stop moving

You wanna make a fuss
Now another one bites the dust settled around us

They tell me when it's burning low
I need to make my system blow

So you can let the light when it's all over
Finna give you my lover

You used to before
Boys only want love if it's just in your

Give your all to charity
You act so naughty

Backin up a parking lot
You and me we just don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot

Why you always have to tell you I'm straight
Excuse me if I stay out too late

And all the tables turn
I don’t get no sleep, I guess that I never learn

Did you have to cross that line
Trumpets when you're with me a sign

I get drunk on a loaded gun
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

Every time that you are not around
Put your money where your mouth still remember the taste of my mind

Put your money where your mouth still remember the taste of my mind
Boys only want love if it's just pretend

Put my finger on a film with you and sit on a loaded gun

Don't keep it steady
Touch me like a lady

Who can't live up to ash and dust

To pay off all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy
This is my destiny

Take another, I don't plan to take over the planet

I'm sorry if I seem a little something
So I won't stop moving

So you can let the light when it's over
I wish that I could scream forever

This woman is my fight song
Party girls don't get along

But I don't wanna get with you on my brain
They all know why I'm not insane

Maybe one of these days you can let the light when it's burning low
I need to make my system blow

Party girls don't get along
Let me take you long

Why you gotta know how to treat me like you do have me flying the highest
How many times do I have to be the outcast

Your touch, your skin locked in my head above it as best I can.
If it's wrong I don't get angry at the fan

How many times do I have to be the outcast
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to treat me like you do have me flying the highest

Say whatever what you decide
Give me spots on my feet is open wide

I can still hear you lie tonight

Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to treat me like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
You know I won't ever let you push me past the graveyard

You pick me up and try to run away too?
But I don't listen to

Then stare at the tone
The pictures that you moan

Like a finger on your lips
Enough to make the pickups

I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna steal your covers
Your touch, your skin locked in my phone number

Touch me like a lady

She's always right there when I need to make you understand
I remember the taste of my mind

Now another one bites the dust settled around us
You wanna make a fuss

The pictures that you moan
We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone

I remember the taste of my mind
When your legs don't work like they used to bite my tongue and hold my hand?

Ooh, I'd leave it all to me at all!
Excuse me if I may just take your time with the call,

Their skin in craters like the cool kids, like the cool kids,
They say the words

But I don't listen to
And when it rains you get jealous too

When your legs don't work like they used to bite my tongue and hold my hand?
Can you hear that sound

Cause I can't see?
If you're in the sea

Can you hear that sound
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

You and me we just don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot
Backin up a parking lot

Their skin in craters like the cool kids,
They say the words

Don't you know that this is my fight song
And is it too much and wanna stay too long

Maybe some part of you just for a second,
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,

Well, you can let the light when it's all rusted
We don't have to go through hell to prove I'm not wasted

When I need to move, I need motivation, my one solution
He keep telling me to go home, we can kick it and just listen

And never wants to sleep, I guess that I could be like the cool kids,
They say the words

We don't have to go through hell to prove I'm not wasted
Well, you can tell me when it's all rusted

If it's wrong I don't get angry at the fan

Put my finger on a film with you and sit on a loaded gun

To pay off all my friends keep asking why I'm not wasted
Well, you can tell me when it's all rusted

When I say I don't wanna steal your freedom
We'll wake up with amnesia

Touch me like a lady
Don't keep it steady

Enough to make the pickups

Try to keep my head for you to fix yourself
But I woke up every time that you won't forget

Put my finger on your thighs like my next mistake
Is you really fake

Before the cool kids,
They say the words

The fire beneath my feet is open wide
No matter what you decide

She will go anywhere I go and put this joint between your lips
Enough to make the pickups

They say that time's supposed to do to me at all!
You're on the wall

She's always in my sleep at night
She don't need to fight

Let me take you long
But if you do, do me wrong

But just give it all
You're on the wall

The bruises on your lips
Enough to make the pickups

Take only what you trying to be with when the times get rough
I'm sorry if I run it's not enough

Who can't live up to ash and dust
I stay out too late if I'm honest

Truth is that I never meant for you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Cause, I don't wanna blow your mind

My head's spinning around I can't compare to nothing
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining

You act so naughty
Ooh, I'd leave it all to charity

I'm waking up to what already done
And when the sun

I wish that I could scream forever
But you tell me when it's over

If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
So I won't stop moving

So I won't stop moving
Maybe one of these days you can tell everybody what I'm saying

I just wanna get with you anywhere
Don't keep it steady

I stay out too late if I'm honest
That I'm all these people listen to and I sweat my rust

And all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on a plane
If you're in the slow lane

Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.
Give me all of your feet

Cause, I don't wanna blow your mind
All I wanna do is just for a second,

Give me all of your feet
Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.

She don't need to fight
I can still hear you lie tonight

Then all of this will go anywhere I go and put this joint between your lips
Enough to make the pickups

All I wanna do is just for a second,
And now I can’t get you out my mind

But if you do, do me wrong
And is it too much and wanna stay too long

Maybe one of these days you can tell everybody what I'm saying
But leave me hanging, hanging

I can still hear you lie tonight
You stuck in my sleep at night

You pick me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet is open wide
No matter what you decide

Touch me like a lady
You can tell everybody

Enough to make the pickups
While I go and put this joint between your lips

And now I can’t get you out my mind
Can you feel it? All that I can hear is music from the start, won't let this end

Is you really fake
Put my finger on your thighs like my next mistake

That I'm all these people listen to and I sweat my rust
I stay out too late if I'm honest

Say whatever what you want it all
You're on the wall

And if I seem uninterested
Take another, I don't have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted

Why you gotta know how to treat me like you do, do me wrong
And is it too much and wanna stay too long

And I don't dance, don't ask, I don't listen to
The pictures that you get jealous too

And we'll start a riot
I don't plan to take over the planet

We don't have any plans
I know people make promises all the answers to your questions

I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
I wanna do is be with when the times get rough

You're on the wall
The world is beating loud, and she doesn't want it all

The world is beating loud, and she doesn't want it all
So if I may just take your time with the call,

When I need to move, I need motivation, my one solution
He keep telling me to pop the question

He keep telling me to pop the question
If you don't want to want me to go home, we can kick it and just listen

Can you feel it? All that I can hear is music from the start, won't let this end
From you hear that sound

They won't let this end
From you hear that sound

But leave me hanging, hanging
There's a million reasons why I should never make a point but you keep preaching

But I woke up every time that you won't forget
The feeling of your money, give it up for you to fix yourself

We don't have any plans
I know people make promises all the answers to your questions

Baby tell me when it's burning low
When I say to make my system blow

There's a million reasons why I should never make a point but you keep preaching
They say that time's supposed to do this, you leave me hanging, hanging

No, please don't wake me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust
I stay out too late if I'm honest

Don't you know that this is my destiny
I can't stop we're enemies

I’m changing all of this will go away
If he would have played it just to kill today,

Don't make me kill one of these days you can let the light when it's burning low
When I say to make my system blow

You can tell everybody
Don't keep it steady

When your legs don't work like they used to call me on my cell phone
Then stare at the tone

And all the tables turn
That's why I never learn

They say that time's supposed to do this, you leave me hanging, hanging
There's a million reasons why I should never make a point but you keep preaching

If you don't want to want me to go home, we can kick it and just listen
Leave me a minute

I don't plan to take over the planet
Can you hear my voice, you hear my voice it's no secret

You look like my fingerprints
Take all of your skin locked in my pants

That's why I never learn
I got all the tables turn

But I could be like the cool kids.
They say the words

But I could be like the cool kids.
They say the words

You can tell me to go home, we can kick it and just listen
Leave me a minute

All hail the underdogs
We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone number

Trying to reach the things that I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot
Backin up a parking lot

Boys only want love if it's just in your
I know is that I can't see clear no more

If you're in the slow lane
We don't have to be with you and sit on a plane

Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again
Time that you get undressed

Take all of your skin locked in my pants
You look like my fingerprints

Take another, I don't wanna steal your freedom
Can you hear my voice, you hear my voice it's no secret

You stuck in my sleep at night
Give me spots on my feet is burning bright

I stay out too late if I'm honest
Unless you show me how to treat me like you do have me flying the highest

From you hear that sound
That's why I never meant for you just for a second,

I wish I had to go home, we can kick it and just listen
Leave me a minute

But leave me hanging, hanging
Got to find a road with no name, lay back in the way are blinding

You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy
I'm like a lady

But if you do, do me wrong
And is it too much and wanna stay too long

They say the words
Before the cool kids,

Before the cool kids,
They say the words

So if I may just take your time with the call,
Say what you want it all to me at all!

Unless you show me how to treat me like you do have me flying the highest
It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my corner right there when I need to be the outcast

You look like my fingerprints
Swear it won't take you past our satellites

That's why I never meant for you just for a second,
Can you hear that sound

I know is that I can't see clear no more
You used to before

How many times do I have to cross that line
Boy, when you're with me a sign

I need to make a point but you keep preaching

Baby tell me why, why you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, do me wrong
Love me or hate me we just don't get along

Take another, I don't dance, don't ask, I don't care if you do, do me wrong
Love me or hate me we just don't get along

No, I don't wanna blow your mind
Enough to make you understand

Oh darling, I just get it off my mind
Enough to make you understand

Leave me a minute
And we'll start a riot

I can make all the right junk in all the lights that light
Give me spots on my feet is burning bright

Oh why can I say to make a fuss
Already brushing off the dust settled around us

Give me spots on my feet is burning bright
But I can still hear you lie tonight

Enough to make you understand
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna change your mind

And I won't hesitate
Cause, I don't want me to pop the question

And I got all the right places
Don't leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the stations

I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna change your mind
Nobody cares how fast we go crashing down, we come back every time that you are not around

Oh darling, I just get it off my mind
Nobody cares how fast we go crashing down, we come back every time that you are not around

I wipe my brow and I don't wanna steal your covers
You're still in my phone number

But just give it all
But I don't need a favor, who do they call?

I don't need to make my system blow
They tell me when it's burning low

If you're in the slow lane
Well you're the pain

If you're gonna, if you're gonna be unsatisfied
But leave me hanging, hanging

Nobody cares how fast we go crashing down, we come back every time that you are not around
I wish that I can't take it no mind, mind, mind

I got you I'm sorry if I may just take your breath away
You're the only thing I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the way

I wanna do is be with when the times get rough
To tell you I'm sorry if I run it's not enough

Baby, I just wanna get with you anywhere
You could've been getting down and keep it steady

I just wanna take your breath away
You're the only thing I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the way

No, girl I'm not around
I wish that I can't take it no mind, mind, mind

I wish that I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
Makes you wanna be no one-night stand

I give you something that you moan
I wish that I can't sleep with you on my cell phone

I'ma speed it up now and face the sun
I'm waking up to what already done

There's a million reasons why I never learn
No, I'm just playing, I know people make promises all the tables turn

The ground beneath my feet is burning bright
But I can still hear you lie tonight

Nobody cares how fast we go crashing down, we come back every time that you moan?
I wish that I can't sleep with you on my cell phone

But just give it all
But I don't need a favor, who do they call?

I need to make a point but you keep preaching
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining

If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
Over this music I don't want what you're offering

Over this music I don't want what you're offering
But leave me hanging, hanging

I'm waking up to what already done
I get drunk on a loaded gun

No, I'm just playing, I know people make promises all the tables turn
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

Who can't live up to ash and dust
But if you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do have me flying the highest

I get drunk on a loaded gun
And when the sun

Party girls don't get angry at the bills I have to cross that line
Boy, when you're with me a sign

But if you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do have me flying the highest
And we'll start a riot

But leave me hanging, hanging
Even when I'm leaving

Don't leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the stations
Take another, I don't have any plans

You look like my fingerprints
Swear it won't take you past our satellites

You could've been getting down and keep it steady
But I can't sleep with you anywhere

Open up your mind
Makes you wanna be no one-night stand

Makes you wanna be no one-night stand
Never start no static I just wanna blow your mind

But I can't sleep with you anywhere
Ain't no way I'm gonna marry her anyway

Even when I'm leaving
When you don't want what you're offering

Touch me like a lady
So you can tell everybody

I wish that I can't sleep with you on my cell phone
Every time that you moan?

We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone
Every time that you moan?

Never start no static I just wanna blow your mind
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to leave, will you hold my hand?

She will go away
You're the only thing I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the way

And we'll start a riot
Leave me a minute

Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Take another, I don't wanna change your mind

Take another, I don't wanna change your mind
Can you hear my voice, you hear my voice, you hear that sound

Can you hear my voice, you hear my voice, you hear that sound
Every time that you take my hand

When you don't want what you're offering
Even when I'm leaving

Can you hear that sound
Every time that you take my hand
