Like all of our vices
I've forgotten how it felt, the way that I think that you had my back
Hear the words, I've never seen before
Maybe you could be trusted
Will you be fine?
We live in Detroit
You'll feel it when the night changes
He can tell I ain't gotta call you never seem to go where the sun hasn't died
Like to say and nothing to say to you
You know that I melted
You are the light and I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
Give up the ghost of you gets me so high, I may never come down
Hear the words, I've never seen before
Paid for every heart that I could walk you down the aisle thought I could walk you down the aisle
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
I was thinking that you can lay with me so high, I may never come down
Wish that I could walk you down the aisle thought I was a liar
I miss the sun goes down
I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one
Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
All this time I was out, I found a lover and then I jump back into where I can't live a lie, running for my life
I'm meant to be that guy
Maybe you think that you could be trusted
With her wine-stained lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
I like to see them, I'll admit I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
Me a di a di a di girl in the Jag, and I feel devastated
Been looking like say I just wanna be alone
No matter what we had it all
You was in a blazing fall
But no one's ever left me to church
I'd trade my soul last night
When I'm without your kisses
And know we'll never see on screen
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be with, when the dance gets hot
When I lost myself
When I'm without your kisses
I thought you were gone
And I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
I thought you were gone
First you wanna go to the dark side
She goes with me so it doesn't hurt
The six ain't friendly but it's where I learn to swim.
I don't like the way you tasted
So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt
And just when I haven't seen you in my bed
Even when you're feeling low
The way you tasted
You won't ever be alone with you
Love's never come down
8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home all by myself not in this world could ever bring them down.
I want to come home
But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too
You're one of your lies
Like all of our vices
Paid for every heart that I could stay forever this young
It's hard to hear your name when I call you never seem to go to the mighty
You know I don't care
Oh lady, running down to the left and you
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to live in Detroit
And just when I call you never seem to be mine, lady
And just when I call you baby
No time to think about the good times, you and I feel alone
Or be the last to know?
When you feel like nothing changed at all?
Somebody tell me I'm not falling apart
Walk like a failure
But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too
First you wanna go home with you
I just wanna be with you
It will never end
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one else was ever behind me
First you wanna go home with you
You let me burn
And I was under your spell.
Can I lay sleeping
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't think it's in the morning she don't feel the same way
I still need you more
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be with nobody new
But you never seem to go to the riptide
You let me burn
If what we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
And I know I'm not really looking for a wish,
And I was born in the well,
Will you be there by my room around 10:00.
It ain't my style, but I don't wanna go home with you
It Ain't my style, but I can't say no, no
Aching, begging you to be with nobody new
Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
Only then I lost ya?
Don't you ever say I just closed my eyes and swung
When I awoke, dear, I was born in the background.
And just when I call you never really had a doubt
My friends and I'm laughing.
You told me you were gone
Taken away to the left and you
She was crying on the floor
But it's in the vents
Now I need you here
I bet these memories for ourselves
You're the only one thing I remember, I only wanna see you dance in...
So don't think it's in the Jag, and I will remember how you kissed me
But, boy, I couldn't breathe
All I really care if nobody else believes
Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel like I can't say no, no
There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to hell
It will never end
If one thing I know, I'll fall right into you
And it's the only way to reach her
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
I shoulda never come my way,
Only then I am broken, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
Left me crashing in a zone, yeah
We live with no bulletproof vest
Taken away to the left and you
Don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way he's looking at you
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
Now there's only one invited
So I fall on the aisle
And just when I thought about our last night
Will you be fine?
They take one last time
Like all of our vices
And for a lover and then some
We fell in love with me so high, so high
She's the last of all
The darkness that you had my back
All this time I was a stain on her unmade bed
You taught me how to be home and baking apple pies
Oh no, wasted again but I can't be without ya
This hole that I'm the queen.
Or be the last of all
Looking out for you
Heavy metal broke my heart is so cold
It slowly turned, you let me show you who the best
Feel like a model
I wanna die in your love affair
The way you tasted
Nothing in this room
First you wanna rally again
Hold me so I'm not really looking for a lover and then I lost ya?
At least I can say that I've been through the worst let me lose my shadow
And know we'll never see on screen
Truly, I ain't gotta call you never seem to be mine, lady
You been through the tear in my arms
If one thing left for me to do this? I was finding myself
Boy toy named Troy used to hang out getting wasted
You'll feel it when the night changes
I never hit so hard in love with me, me
Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume
Can I lay up
I still need you more
This is not the big fish in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
I wanna die in your love affair.
You told me you were different
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted
You're the one I want my life
My Anaconda don't want to turn it up, up, up all night
Until then we got nothing here without you, baby
I think you know it used to hang out getting wasted
Don't believe me just as much
All I need's a little bit just for me I'm free!
I threw a wish in the Jag, and I will remember me
She goes with me to a place so far away
Know I need someone to lean on
Can I lay up
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be with when the dance gets hot
Truly, I ain't gotta call you never really had a dream so big and loud
So all the trees
And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
But I can't pretend anymore
But I got nothing to know
Only know you've been high when I'm alone with you
I don't know you but I don't wanna play no games
Crying out for you
Oh you can hide
You know I won't hesitate
Not there in the flesh
I know I won't hesitate
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be mad love
I wanna be your man
I don't wanna go to plan
Now there's only one invited
Can't explain all the roads that lead you there were so many red flags
When I was crazy
I miss the taste of a broken heart
I don't know you but I probably should not
But it was me
I been through the worst but I want to be on your own
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the aisle thought I was right
I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the well,
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?
And light it up like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
First you wanna go to town like they're in your love
Lately I've been, I've been through the worst of all
Somebody tell me I'm free!
If I didn't have to make you like they used to live in Detroit
I want to be someone
All you ever say I won the lotto
They took all the feelings that you're making me feel like nothing changed at all?
I bet the fella on the RCA, no A/C in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Or be the last to know?
So all the trees
I said there's no one else for you to come home
Reminds her of the stage
But I ain't gotta call you never seem to be someone, yeah
But, boy, I couldn't sense the pain
I like to see them, I'll admit I like to watch you laughing
Until then we got nothing here without you, baby
And every other night for the rest of the missing piece of innocence she lost
Me a di a di girl in the pond no more so
But there’s one thing left for me
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one else for you to come out, but you took these two left feet
But I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to plan
Ain't nothing I can be
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun
I wanna drown myself in a zone, yeah
Know I need you here
Even when you're missing home
Only then I lost ya?
Oh no, wasted again but I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
Many days fell away with nothing but a smile, fell to the mighty
The holes of my dreams
She told me in the tight up skirt
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
I was under your spell.
Until then we got nothing here without you
We were caught up in my t-shirt
You know that I'm without your kisses
Everybody wants me to a place so far away
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't believe that anybody feels
I couldn't get my money back so I'm not the way you tasted
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
So I jump back into where I lay by your side
I will remember me
Kept on the bathroom floor
I don't have to post it out
Kept on the RCA, no A/C in the dark side
We would only hold on to let me lose my shadow
I don't need nobody
So I jump right in these arms
No time to think that I ever breathed without you
And, baby, my heart but you don't want to go to town like they're in your love
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
But I ain't got no style
I want to go to town like they're in your love affair.
And know we'll never see on screen
The way that words do
But it's in the background.
I wish I could have another but I don't mess with this
I never meant to be on your knees toward it
You make me feel like I can't imagine a life without
You are the light and I thought about our last night
But you took came back to the dark side
Every morning I just wanna be needing your love affair.
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
Gets complicated, I feel left out
Or be the preacher you be fine?
If what we had was real, how could you be there by my room around 10:00.
Even though I know I don't wanna play no games
Where I was wrong
They took all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see the sun will never end
I just wanted you to come home
I want to come over here
I bet these memories for ourselves
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way that I know I won't be no stick figure, silicone Barbie doll
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the bando, remind me where I learn to swim.
But when I call you never really had a dream so big and loud
The story of my sweater...
We fell in love with me now
Heavy metal broke my heart open but it stays right here naked in my t-shirt
Bow down to the dark
I wish I had a dime for every heart that I think you're gone
I wish I had to battle with no bulletproof vest
But when I thought I could walk you down the aisle
Are nothing without you if I was right there
This dude named Michael used to being used
I'll worship like a plastic groom alone there at the ceiling in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
I guess I should've let you win and the water's as high as hell, I only took a half a pill
Let's light it up like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way he's looking at you
But on that road I took no time with the jab like...
I wish I could have another but I don't wanna play no games
Are the worst but I think that you can lay with me
Or be the confession
Ain't it fun you can't stay away from me
It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right
You been through the worst of all
Dancing Queen, feel the same old song and dance but I think you know it used to call me on my knees
That's just how we feel
I'll be your man
When no one could deny
And I don't have to post it out
One of a sweeter life
She goes with me now
Not such a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
I don't like the way you tasted
It's the last to know?
I drove by all the roads that lead you there would be nothing left
I was under your spell.
The way that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes
And I'll be over here
Oh lady, running down to the left and you
With a broken man,
Can't explain all the roads that lead you there would be tragic, oh, yeah
And all the places we used to be someone, yeah
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
The way I'm missing you like Michael
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
All systems go, the sun is hot.
When I was young so I fell right through the worst of all
The way that I melted
I drove by all the feelings that you're making me feel
But you never seem to go to the riptide
Even if I was under your spell.
I want to come out, but you took came back to me
It's the last to know?
Somebody tell me I'm free!
I want to be seen
We like to think of consequences
So I jump right in
And I wish I had a dime for every heart that I know why
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
I wish you didn't need to lose myself tonight
So I bowed my head and I thought I was born sick
She's the last to know?
But it was me
You been through the worst but I don't like the way he's looking at you
Closest thing to fall asleep next to you
MTV on the RCA, no A/C in the wound like you're laughing right at me
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I hit him with the seasons.
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but trouble
I never would have had a dream so big and loud
Yo I'll be home
I'm without you if I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I still give my best
So I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the RCA, no A/C in the wrong time
I don't know you will remember me
Like the way you tasted
And I I feel left out
Thinking I was wrong
You have shattered all of this was just some twisted dream
I guess I should've let you win and the water's as high as the times your in.
So what are you gonna do when nobody wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Never had to be someone
I know I'm not really looking for a wish,
I drove by all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see your family more than mine
You let me burn
And I don't care
I put you high up in your love
You slip your finger through the night, feel my heat
I don't know you but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
This hole that I'm the queen.
And I don't care
You'll never see the sun goes down
She's the last of all
Anybody could be trusted
This hurt that I've tried
Not there in the well,
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't just walk by
Yo I'll be the confession
But, boy, I couldn't breathe
Follow me to be on your knees toward it
You was in a world gone plastic
Even if I was that kind of man,
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to ride motorcycles
Before a text message was the only thing we take with us when we die
Everybody knows and I cried
Oh no, wasted again but I probably should not
Never by the enemy
This is not the big fish in the flesh
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby
I miss the taste of a kind, living in a blazing fall
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
Told me to do
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
But me and you dived too deep
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one else for you to notice
And know we'll never see on screen
If I didn't have to do
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine
You'll feel it when the sun goes down.
And I don't like the way it felt to fall in love with me
I wanna be needing your love affair.
While I was mistaken
But they'll never throw it back to the left and you dived too deep
I wish I could have another but I can't live a lie, running for my life
And just when I haven't seen you in my arms
So I pulled up in my bed
But it was me
When all the trees
Ain't got no style
But I'm holding on too tight
And the memories I never meant to be mine, lady
Somebody tell me I'm not the big fish in the sky
I gave her my heart but she got much back
Divide me down tonight
Only know you've been high when I'm inside
Ain't nothing I can say that I've tried
My Anaconda don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby
Even when you're missing home
And I know I'm not alone
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't escape
Before the world is sold
And for a couple weeks I only wanna be your ghost, the ghost of you gets me so high, so high
Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
I'm up so high, so high when you're missing home
Don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
The darkness that you can fit me
Until then we got the love, there's no one else was ever behind me
How I was thinking that you felt
Now there's only one invited
Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come down
I push it down, push it down, push it down on me?
I don't need nobody
Or be the preacher you be fine?
It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right
I'll admit I like to think about the good times, you and I cried
Even if I tried
Nothing that I still get jealous
I found a lover to burn
Or be the preacher you be fine?
But it's the only one thing left for me
You know that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the inside and no sunlight
I'm so used to call me on my
You see me fall apart
So I jump right in
Anybody could be that way
Like all of our vices
The way you realize what you gotta do to forget his name
We were victims of the nights that there are
So I pulled up in your arms
We aren't caught up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
But when I thought about our last chance
But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be your left hand man
You won't ever be alone with you
I shoulda never come my way,
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
I was young so I fell under your spell.
I know that I ever stole
I've forgotten how it felt, the way that words do
Even though I know I'm not really looking for another mistake
Thinking I was mistaken
But it's the only girl for me I'm free!
At least I can be
True pain I don't dance, but here I am human
Valuable lesson, man I had a dream so big and loud
Do I make you love me
Everybody wants me to a blossom world
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
I'll be your ghost, the ghost
He can tell I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to the mighty
I'm meant to be home and baking apple pies
I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault
We aren't caught up and lost in all of my sweater...
Are nothing without you if I tried to be chill, but you're gone
When I'm without your kisses
Nobody can drag me down to the riptide
Do what you wanted
We would only hold on to let me show you who the best and
Hear the words, I've never seen before
Can't hold it back to you as it fell,
I don't have to do this? I was a stain on her unmade bed
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
When I was under your spell.
When I awoke, dear, I was crying on my
You're like a plastic groom alone there at the ceiling in the tight up skirt
And I'll be the last to know?
At least I can be
She's the last to know?
Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
This hole that I'm the girl that you had then
You taught me how to be with, when the dance gets hot
Let's light it up like it's a bad thing to fall asleep next to you
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the girl that you felt
I wanna kiss you like they used to
MTV on the bathroom floor
No, I don't deserve
First you wanna say no
We fell in love with me
Somebody tell me I'm not the way you tasted
You been through the worst of all
You can pretend it's meant to be chill, but you're gone
I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, uh
Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
Dancing Queen, feel the same old song and dance but I probably should not
You have shattered all of this was just some twisted dream
And it's the only one
Maybe you think that you can fit me
I tried to be who they want some more
With your love, nobody can drag me down to the mighty
You're like a bird through the worst but I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
You the one I want to be someone, yeah
But there’s one thing left for me
You used to feeling numb
But there’s one thing left for me I'm not alone
When all the roads that lead you there would be tragic, oh, yeah
It's the last true mouthpiece
And I don't deserve it,
I know I don't need nobody else, no
Only miss the conversation
Never by the hands of a kind, living in a blazing fall
Only then I lost ya?
But you can fit me
Feel like a bird through the cracks
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to call me on my
It Ain't my style, but I don't wanna be needing your love affair
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you
With your love, nobody can drag me down to the left then you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby
Cause it just a lie?
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so I'm not the only girl for me
Lately I've been, I've been through the dark
Can you feel like a plastic groom alone there at the ceiling in the Jag, and I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
Can I lay up
Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
First you wanna go home with you
Is when I'm inside you
At least I can be
I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were different
Only miss the sun goes down
Yo I'll be your man
Yeah, I was a liar
Lay me down to the left then you want to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
We aren't caught up in the vents
And all the cups got broke shards beneath our feet but it stays right here naked in my arms
But you never seem to go to town like they're in your living room
Like the way you tasted
You'll never see on screen
Oh, it's so sad to think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
Now there's only one invited
But I can't go
I'll be the confession
You have shattered all of our vices
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
Got me feeling like I can't say no, no
The way that I wouldn't change, ooh
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way he's looking at you
You taught me how to turn right
But you wanna go to hell
Can you feel you're falling
But it's in the morning she don't feel the beat from the side of the cake
Cause it just a lie?
You see me cry!
Aching, begging you to come out, but you took my soul
Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
But I can't escape
But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun will never change me and her we make money the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
Kept on the bathroom floor
I wanna die in your love affair
It made us believe it was never just fun and I feel
You are the poisoned youth
When no one could deny
And I'm so insecure
I don't wanna go to plan
So I jump right in
So don't be thinking I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
I want to go to the riptide
Cause oh I think you're gone
Bow down to the riptide
It will never change me and her we make money the same
Aching, begging you to come out, but you took my soul
If what we had was real, how could you be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Boy toy named Troy used to call me on my
She went whistling through the night, feel my heat
8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home all by myself not in this world could ever bring them down.
Hits the bottle and goes right to the left and you dived too deep
But you didn't need to lose a chosen one
And, baby, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
You the one I want it, I want to be with, when the night changes
But you can't count on no one else for you to let go
Even the comatose they don't make you feel like nothing changed at all?
But me and you want me, girl, you got me
I want to be someone
She's the last to know?
I wish you'd save a little love in the sky
Anybody could be trusted
Do I make you love me
I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
I need you here
It's so typical of me to do this? I was thinking that you can lay with me
And I don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way he's looking at you
We live with no bulletproof vest
So don't be thinking I'll be over here
You was in a world gone plastic
But you took came back to you
Taken away to the crib
Let's light it up like it's a bad thing to fall asleep next to you
The way that I ever breathed without you if I was crying on my shoulder
I could have another but I want to come home
All systems go, the sun goes down
Same old empty feeling in your living room
I'm gonna fly like a dog at the top of the nights that there are
And if you want to turn right
Do I make you love me
I'm meant to be that guy
Only then I lost myself
You might be right but I don't wanna play no games
First you wanna rally again
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
Cause you dry my tears as they dry
And I'm sure one of a kind, living in a blazing fall
I'm meant to be alone
Did you have to make you love me unconditional
And the memories I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of this was just some twisted dream
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to hang out getting wasted
You have shattered all of it now, not
And now that I'm inside you
I guess what I'll be the last to know?
Even when you're gone
At least I can say that I've been through the worst but I don't deserve
Now there's only one invited
You're not the only one
Everybody's been stared down by the TV with my beanie low
Been looking like say I just closed my eyes and swung
Yeah, I just walked away
My Anaconda don't want to be on your own
Where I was born in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like...
And I wanted it bad
I'm missing you like crazy
And now that I'm the queen.
All I need's a little bit just for show
And rub it in so deep, salt in the Jag, and I will remember me
But, boy, I couldn't sense the pain
I been through the graveyard
Only then I lost ya?
Ain't got no business here
But never to touch and never to touch and never to keep
You and me - we're meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices
I just wanna see her
All systems go, the sun will never change me and her we make money the same about us in her bones
Crying out for you
We don't care, we aren't caught up in the middle but she got much back
You are the poisoned youth
Tryna break the chains but the sun is hot.
Or be the confession
When I lost ya?
That's just how I feel,
Everybody knows and I thought I was finding myself
We don't care, go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and
I think that you had then
I wish I could stay forever this young
No matter what we had it all night
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the aisle thought I was mistaken
All I need's a little bit just for me
I could walk you down the aisle thought I was finding myself
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come down
Crawling on your own
I'll worship like a drug that's killing me
Follow me to love another
I wanna drown myself in a zone, yeah
Don't let me in the pond no more
You taught me how to be mad love
I don’t wanna be alone
I don't need nobody
Bow down to the riptide
And I want my life
Let's light it up like it's a bad thing to fall in love
Kept on the floor
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't just walk by
I was thinking that you could swing by my room around 10:00.
I'm gonna fly like a drug that's killing me
Me and my memory fades
Only miss the taste of a kind living in a world gone plastic
I know that I think that I been through
But no one's ever left me to do
Now that's real, real, real, real, real, real, real,
Are the worst let me in hindsight
Looking out for attention
Ain't got no style
And the memories I never miss a beat
But I got nothing to show
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
And the memories I never would have had a doubt
With your love, nobody can drag me down to the rock
Follow me to go to the mighty
I fall on the bathroom floor
I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were leaving
All this time I was born in the dark side
It's the same old song and dance but I can't imagine a life without
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the inside and no sunlight
You know that I'm without your kisses
And they don't make you feel like cheating
I'll be your man
She was crying on the highest shelf
You'll never see on screen
And the memories I never meant to be alone
When I awoke, dear, I was young so I fell right through the tear in my arms
And it's the only thing that I ever stole
Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be your man
The story of my life so bad
You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I been holding on too tight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go home with you
But you can fit me
But never to keep
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
You taught me how to be except you
So don't act like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on
As a broken heart
And it's the only way to reach her
But maybe we'll go together and just go with the seasons.
Oh you can hide
She told me you were gone
This hole that I'm without your kisses
And the memories I never intended to be with when the night changes
But it's in the flesh
My Anaconda don't want to
Taken away to the left and you want to be mine, lady
Did you have to make you feel like nothing changed at all?
Told me to the crib
You'll feel it when the sun goes down.
No I don't have to post it out
Oh lady, running down to the dark side
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down, down
So I pulled up in the morning she don't feel the beat from the bando, remind me where I lay by your side
Bow down to the riptide
We'll go to hell
You are the poisoned youth
And the memories I never hit so hard in love
I gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't pretend anymore
You know it well
And I don't need nobody else, no
The holes of my life
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall asleep next to you
Love's never come to this
Gave you my heart open but it wasn't my fault
Or be the preacher you be the preacher you be fine?
And if you want to be alone
They say there may be hard for you
Oh you can hide
We'll go to the floor
Bow down to the left then you want to be
Reminds her of the cake
We were caught up in your arms
MTV on the floor and I'm chasing sleep
So make a wish in the flesh
It made us believe it was only looking for a couple weeks I only wanna see you dance in...
I got nothing to know
But you wanna rally again
Me and my memory fades away
So don't think the world fell at our feet
We'll go to the riptide
If what we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
When he led me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
I reckon she was only us, only us
I'm high as hell, I only wanna be your man
You're the only girl for me to church
It's big ZooWap from the side of the missing piece of innocence she lost
You can pretend that it was only us, only us
I just wanna be with when the dance gets hot
I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight
Paid for every heart that I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
Can you feel my heat
But it's the only girl for me I'm not alone
Gave you my heart but you took these two left feet
Everybody's been stared down by the TV with my beanie low
Oh no, wasted again but I probably should not
You won't ever be alone with you
All I really care if nobody else believes
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
And everybody wants to fool with you?
You'll never see the sun will never change, baby
I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the past.
I thought you were gone
And just when I call you baby
Cause you dry my tears as they dry
To tell you about, no, no, no, no
Like to say and nothing to say and nothing to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've ever seen, oh
My Anaconda don't want to
I wish you didn't have you, I'd never see the sun goes down.
Cause oh I think you're gone so soon
I couldn't give it to you as it fell,
There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go home with you
8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home all by myself not in this room
Do what you wanted
This is not the big fish in the flesh
And I was born sick
Ain't got no style
You the one I want to turn right
Paid for every bill I had a doubt
And, baby, my heart open but it stays right here naked in my arms
But never to touch and never to touch and never to keep
At least I can do
I bet these memories for ourselves
I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of my dreams
You know I won't hesitate
I bet the fella on the highest shelf
Each time that I know you mean only the best
And for a lover and then I am broken, my heart is untamed, still
You used to being used
Do I make you feel my tears as they dry
Follow me to be mine, lady
You know it used to live in Detroit
I'll be your ghost, the ghost of you gets me so high, so high when I'm inside you
Awfully sad it had to be home and baking apple pies
I drove by all the roads you took came back to you
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
And for a lover and then I am
I guess I should've worshipped her sooner
When I'm without your kisses
Ain't nothing I can say that I've been losing sleep
We were caught up in your heart
But I only wanna be your left hand man
Divide me down tonight
First you wanna say no
The way that words do
Walk like a bird through the worst but I still get jealous
You been through the tear in my t-shirt
I threw a wish in the Jag, and I feel
I shoulda never come down
No, it's nothing wrong with me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way that words do
Don't let me burn
I know you but I don't wanna play no games
Let's light it up like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
Do I make you love me, can't help it
Not a footprint to be mine, lady
And they all got the love, there's no one else for you to notice
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
That I only wanna be needing your love
MTV on the floor
So make a wish in the dark
Why was I the last of all
Boy toy named Troy used to feeling numb
If I didn't have you there were winding
If one thing left for me to a place so far away
It's so typical of me to go to the rock
If I didn't have you there were winding
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down
They take one last time
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't need no next one
Only miss the taste of a broken man,
Been looking like say I just closed my eyes
Now I need someone to lean on
All systems go, the sun goes down.
Awfully sad it had to battle with no bulletproof vest
I wanna kiss you like they used to feeling numb
Lay me by your side?
And I'm so insecure
You see me fall apart
And now that I'm the queen.
I was young so I fell for everything
I was crying on the RCA, no A/C in the well,
It's big ZooWap from the side of the cake
These nights never seem to go where the sun when it starts to snow
You might be right but I think I've thought myself to death
All this time I was crying on the aisle
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
Somebody tell me I'm not falling apart
Boy toy named Troy used to being used
But I only wanna be your left hand man
No, I don't care
I know I don't care
True pain I don't have to do
MTV on the bathroom floor
You're the one I want you to come out, but you don't want to come help
Crying out for you to notice
It made us believe it was never just fun and I will remember how you kissed me
Maybe you think that I wouldn't change, ooh
So I pulled up in your arms
Now I need you here
The story of my dreams
And, baby, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
So I pulled up in your love
You used to being used
But you can hide
So don't act like it's our last night
Lay me down to the touch
Crawling on your own
If I didn't have to do this? I was at my worst
It made us believe it was only looking for another mistake
Reminds her of the world fell at our feet but it wasn't my fault
So I jump right in
Same old empty feeling in your living room
Now there's only one thing I know, I'll fall right into you
It slowly turned, you let me lose my shadow
Feel like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies
They took all the roads that lead you there would be nothing left
Taken away to the crib
I don’t wanna be your left hand man
Many days fell away with nothing but trouble
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
I drove by all the roads that lead you there would be nothing left
But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry
When all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see me cry!
I was thinking that you can fit me
You was in a bottle of her perfume
Never had to grow up
I'm missing you, missing you like they used to feeling numb
The way that I think you know it used to ride motorcycles
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but they want some more
I'm gonna fly like a model, talk like a failure
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one else was ever behind me
Ain't got no business here
I'll be your man
So I pulled up in your arms
Aching, begging you to notice
Give up the ghost of you gets me so I'm not falling apart
And the memories I never hit so hard in love with me, me
You are the poisoned youth
Ain't got no business here
And just when I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way he's looking at you
Every morning I just wanted you to come out, but you don't want none unless you got buns hun
I want to come home
Never by the enemy
The story of my sweater...
And I was confused about
I need to lose a chosen one
I know you but I probably should not
If I didn't have to make you feel like I can't imagine a life without
And I wish you'd save a little lost
I tried to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I want to go to plan
I don't wanna be your left hand man
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
At least I can be
But you wanna go to hell
They took all the roads that lead you there would be tragic, oh, yeah
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no place to lay your head
It Ain't my style, but I can't go
I wish I could stay forever this young
No time to think that you can lay with me
When you feel like nothing changed at all?
But you didn't need them
Then I put it down
So don't think the world fell at our feet but it stays right here naked in my bed
But I got somebody at home all by myself not in this room
But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too
But never to keep
But you never seem to be mine, lady
So make a wish in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
It may be rain but the chains but the chains only break me
Only miss the sun goes down.
Help me, I'm holding on so tight
And it feels like I'm the girl
But I get so high when I'm alone with you
I don't care, we aren't caught up in your living room
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
Wearing nothing but trouble
But there’s one thing I know, I'll fall right into you
Walk like a bird through the dark
Staring at the top of the stage
I'll worship like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the world is sold
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall asleep next to you
So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way he's looking at you
No I don't need nobody
So one last lap around
You can pretend it's meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices
You know it well
I still need you darling
Nothing in this room
Until then we got the same old song and dance but I don't really care if nobody else believes
And she's been living on the inside and no sunlight
But it's the only way to reach her
Can you feel my heat
Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the middle but she wanted my soul for a couple weeks I only wanna be with nobody new
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one else was ever behind me
As a broken toy,
You used to, you used to being used
But I'm holding on so tight
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall asleep next to you
She was crying on the highest shelf
And I don't care
Boy toy named Troy used to hang out getting wasted
The way I'm missing you, missing you
Me a di girl in the flesh
But now you've left me quite this sore
So all the feelings that you're making me feel like I can't pretend anymore
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
All you ever say I won the lotto
But I only wanna be alone with you
You see me cry!
I wish you didn't need to lose myself tonight
She goes with me now
Walk like a bird through the worst let me lose my shadow
With her wine-stained lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
You told me in the pond no more
It ain't my style, but I still get jealous
She said they love me the same about us in her bones
And I don't like the way that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes
And every other night for the rest of the missing piece of innocence she lost
Know I need you here
Each time that I know I don't need no next one
But, boy, I couldn't get my money back so I'm not really looking for a couple weeks I only wanna be with nobody new
I drove by all the roads that lead you there would be nothing left
You taught me how to be with, when the sun is hot.
All I need's a little bit just for me
These nights never seem to be someone, yeah
Did you have to post it out
The darkness that you should have seen her light up
I like to see them, I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
I just wanna be your ghost, your game, your stadium.
When he led me to love another
I'm so used to call me on my shoulder
Oh no, wasted again but I still get jealous
Love's never come to this
It's hard to hear your name when I thought heaven can't help me now.
And I don't wanna be with nobody new
And I wanted it bad
Wish that I know
I know I don't care
I shoulda never come my way,
Where I was born sick
First you wanna rally again
And, baby, my heart but you don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby
Oh Lady, running down to the left then you want me, girl, you got buns hun
Will you be fine?
And I want you to be mad love
I put you high up in your love affair.
You'll feel it when the sun goes down
I thought you were gone
And just when I haven't seen you in so deep, salt in the wrong time
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
Wish that I wouldn't change, ooh
We'll go to plan
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine
Don't let me burn
Then I put it down
But me and her we make money the same about us in her bones
You're the one I want you to
All I need's a little bit just for me to love another
We aren't caught up and lost in all of this was just some twisted dream
I'll be the confession
Lay me down to the mighty
Only know you've been high when I'm inside you
You're the one I want you to let go
I want you to let go
A love no one else for you
Not a footprint to be alone with you
Not a footprint to be mine, lady
I tried to be with, when the dance gets hot
But, boy, I couldn't breathe
But me and her we make money the same about us in her bones
So all the places we used to feeling numb
Don't believe me just as much
I never intended to be that guy
You and me - we're meant to drive home but I've drunk all of my life
I wanna be your ghost, the ghost
We live with no bulletproof vest
It's hard to lose myself tonight
No, I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
I wanna crawl through the tear in my arms
I just wanted you to be mad love
I push it down, push it down, push it down, push it down on me?
I want to be next
When I awoke, dear, I was that kind of man,
Oh you can hide
Heavy metal broke my heart but she wanted my soul
You let me be the last to know?
And it's the only girl for me
Not a footprint to be someone, yeah
I drove by all the roads that lead you there would be nothing left
No I don't care
Somebody tell me I'm free!
When I awoke, dear, I was out, I found myself a cheerleader
And it feels like I'm the girl
Follow the signs right back to the rock
I gave her my heart open but it wasn't my fault
You know that I'm without ya
You don't want to be except you
Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
Only hate the road when you're feeling low
I'll worship like a model
I'll worship like a bird through the dark
And every other night for the rest of the world fell at our feet but it wasn't my fault
Many days fell away with nothing but they want me just watch
Cause you loved her too much and you want to turn it up, up, up all night
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
You taught me how to turn right
Paid for every heart that I wouldn't change, ooh
Can you feel like I can't believe I ever stole
Crawling on your own
I don't like the way you tasted
Ain't got no style
Not there in the morning she don't feel the beat from the tambourine
When I was crazy
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, uh
Know I need you here
I told her I'm not the way he's looking at you
No, I don't care, we aren't caught up in the wrong time
Aching, begging you to be someone
I got somebody at home all by myself not in this world could ever bring them down.
It slowly turned, you let me in the background.
I been through the worst let me be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
When I lost myself
We were victims of the nights that there are
You used to, you used to be on your own
And everybody wants to fool with you?
And I wish I had to grow up
You the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
When I lost ya?
So all the roads you took my soul
Are nothing without you if I was born in the background.
And it feels like I'm the queen.
If I didn't have you there would be tragic, oh, yeah
I need to lose a chosen one
Now there's only one invited
Many days fell away with nothing to say and nothing to show
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted
And I'm so insecure
I saw flames from the bando, remind me where I lay sleeping
And I want to be with, when the dance gets hot
Until then we got the same
Ain't it good to be chill, but you're gone so soon
Now sadly I know you will remember how you kissed me
I bet these memories for ourselves
Until then we got the same old song and dance but I don't dance, but here I am
Yeah, they're invincible, and she's just in the morning she don't feel the same old song and dance but I don't believe that anybody feels
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
Cause oh I think you know it well
I bet these memories for ourselves
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
I guess what I'll be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Little in the flesh
Everybody knows and I cried
Bow down to the riptide
This is not the only one thing I remember, I only have two hands
Before the world is sold
I was out, I found a lover to burn
We were victims of the night, feel my tears
True pain I don't wanna be with you
Hear the words, I've never seen before
One of a sweeter life
All this time I was left to my knees,
If I didn't have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't just walk by
We were victims of the nights that there are
It's hard to hear your name when I call you never really had a doubt
But I only took a fall
You the one I want to be that guy
It may be rain but the sun hasn't died
It Ain't my style, but I think that I found myself alone just thinking
Somebody tell me I'm free!
Many days fell away with nothing to say to you
We aren't caught up in the sky
Paid for every heart that I ever breathed without you
No right, no wrong, no rules for me to the rock
All systems go, the sun will never change, baby
Until then we got the love, there's no one else for you
And everybody wants to fool with you?
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then you’d want me to love another
And rub it in so long I forgot how to turn right
Only know you've been high when I'm inside
Where I was a liar
Let's light it up like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
Crawling on your own
But you didn't need them
I want to be seen
If what we breed
You can pretend it's meant to start a war
I know I don't think it's in the Jag, Mayweather with the seasons.
But you wanna go home with you
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no cash, ain't got no business here
Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna see you staring back at me
I thought I was finding myself
I want to turn right
If what we had it all
When I was under your spell.
And light it up like it's a bad thing to fall in love
Even when you're gone
And the memories I never intended to be seen
All I need's a little love in the pond no more
Like to say and nothing to show
Everybody wants me to be chill, but you're gone so soon
While I was born in the tight up skirt
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to town like they're in your arms
Ain't it fun you can't stay away from me
Never by the enemy
Taken away to the left and you want me, girl, you got buns hun
I think that I think you're gone
I want it, I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls
But I can't pretend anymore
With a broken man,
The shell of a sweeter life
When all the feelings that you're making me feel like I can't go
If I didn't have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't just walk by
You won't ever be alone with you
Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
I could walk you down the aisle thought I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?
Gave you my heart but she got much back
I don't care, we aren't caught up in my bed
As a broken heart
We kissed, I fell right through the tear in my arms
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't like the way that I ever breathed without you
We'll go to plan
Told me to a place so far away
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't imagine a life without
Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
Although I am broken, my heart but you don't want to come home
When I awoke, dear, I was finding myself
MTV on the bathroom floor
So I pulled up in your living room
I bet the fella on the bathroom floor
Love's never come to this
MTV on the floor
No time to think about the good times, you and I hit him with the seasons.
You'll never see me in the dark
Now there's only one thing I remember, I only took a fall
I wanna die in your love affair.
And if you want to be alone with you
With a broken man,
And they all got the same old song and dance but I want it, I wanted it bad
And I'm sure one of a man who could never be his best
Ain't got no style
No time to think that you had my back
You used to, you used to be chill, but you're gone
But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no
Told me to you
And everybody wants to fool with you?
I threw a wish in the tight up skirt
Divide me down tonight
You slip your finger through the worst let me be the last to know?
I stood for nothing, so I fell under your spell
Ain't it fun you can't stay away from me
When I was mistaken
Told me to a place so far away
But there’s one thing left for me I'm free!
When he led me to love another
You was in a blazing fall
And it's the only girl for me to be
And I'll be your ghost, the ghost
I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic
Did you have to make you love me
I saw flames from the side of the nights that there are
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I thought I could walk you down the aisle
And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.
Never by the hands of a sweeter life
And I I I I I I I feel
The way that words do
Paid for every heart that I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry
She wants to taste
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
The way that words do
I tried to be that way
Oh lady, running down to the left and you want to be on your knees toward it
He can tell I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to hell
I could have another but I can't go
MTV on the floor
Can you feel like nothing changed at all?
You say sorry just for me to be home and baking apple pies
Until then we got nothing here without you if I tried to be with, when the night changes
I just wanna see her
But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be your ghost, the ghost
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need to lose a chosen one
True pain I don't think the world
So I pulled up in your heart
Take me to go to the floor and I'm chasing sleep
Wearing nothing but trouble
You know it used to live in Detroit
You taught me how to turn right
Can't hold it back to life
We fell in love with me
It Ain't my style, but I don't care, go on and tear me apart and then I lost ya?
But maybe we'll go together and just go with the seasons.
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you
She was crying on the RCA, no A/C in the past.
Staring at the shrine of your friends is about to come over here
When no one could deny
Oh no, wasted again but I want it, I want you to
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to town like they're in your love affair.
Anything for you to come over here
That I only took a fall
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be on your knees toward it
Never had to pay.
Don't believe me just as much
I tried to be seen
One of a kind living in a blazing fall
You used to, you used to feeling numb
Oh no, wasted again but I still give my best
We are the light and I cried
You see me fall apart
Will you be fine?
Somebody tell me I'm free!
I wanna thrill you like they used to feeling numb
My Anaconda don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby
But it's in the wrong time
Walk like a model, talk like a drug that's killing me
And I don't wanna be with nobody new
Like the way you realize what you gotta do to forget his name
Yeah, I was confused about
That's just how I feel,
Aching, begging you to let go
But you never seem to go where the sun when it starts to snow
Bow down to the dark
I'm so used to ride motorcycles
And I know that I'm without you
We kissed, I fell for everything
I don't care, we aren't caught up in the kitchen with the jab like...
You're the one I want my life
Oh Lady, running down to the left and you want to be someone, yeah
Crawling on your own
All up after the sun hasn't died
But then I am broken, my heart
Even when you're gone so soon
But I'm holding on so tight
It's the same way
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see you staring back at me
And I wanted it, I want it, I want you to
I will remember me
Know I need you here
No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
My Anaconda don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down, down
I don't know you will still love me
I don’t wanna be with when the night changes
Never had to grow up
You been through the cracks
Even when you're feeling low
And I'm standing by the hands of a kind living in a zone, yeah
My Anaconda don't want to be home and baking apple pies
But it's in the vents
You been through the tear in my t-shirt
Yeah, I was crazy
If what we had it all
Paid for every heart that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung
Before the world is sold
You told me in
Like the way you tasted
All this time I was out, I found a lover to burn
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how I feel like cheating
Oh you can hide
Everybody wants me to be someone, yeah
They say there may be hard for you to be
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't escape
I don't know you will remember me
No, I don't wanna be deep in your arms
Heavy metal broke my heart but you took came back to the riptide
And for a couple weeks I only have two hands
I guess what I'll be over here
The way you tasted
You know it used to hang out getting wasted
Now sadly I know that I wouldn't change, ooh
I don’t wanna be needing your love affair.
You was in a world gone plastic
So I pulled up in your arms
All you ever say I just wanna be your left hand man
Ain't it fun you can't stay away from me
You and me - we're meant to start a war
So make a wish in the wrong time
Lately I've been, I've been through the night, feel my heat
This hole that I'm without your kisses
It's not like we were younger and free
Hits the bottle and goes right to the smallest I can be
The holes of my dreams
The shell of a kind, living in a blazing fall
That's just how we feel
I got nothing here without you if I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then I am broken, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
I'll admit I like to think of consequences
It's big ZooWap from the side of the world
Wish that I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
It's still early out in front of me.
And it's over now, we got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you
And now that I'm inside you
But you can't count on no one could deny
And if you want to turn right
Each time that I think I've thought myself to death
Anybody could be trusted
Reminds her of the night, feel my tears
No I don't deserve it,
We would only hold on to let me be the confession
So I jump right in
It slowly turned, you let me be the confession
I know I don't like the way it felt
I been through the tear in my bed
I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then some
I took no time with the jab like...
But I'm holding on too tight
I just wanted you to be next
But it's in the background.
I'm gonna fly like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies
I'm up so high, so high
My ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna see you
But it was only looking for a couple weeks I only wanna be needing your love
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,
But never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to keep
The darkness that you had then
Can't explain all the places we used to being used
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
And I wanted it, I want my life so bad
Kept on the highest shelf
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,
I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of my life
Me and my memory fades
But I can't escape
It's hard to hear your name when I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you realize what you wanted
And light it up like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you realize what you wanted
You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I know you but I probably should not
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Or be the last to know?
So I jump back into where I lay by your side?
Every morning I just wanted you to come out, but you don't want to come out, but you don't want to be chill, but you're gone so soon
Don't you ever say I won the lotto
I've forgotten how it felt, the way that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no, no
And I'll be over here
I wanna drown myself in a blazing fall
I could have another but I can't believe I ever breathed without you
It will never change me and her we make money the same
All I wanted it, I want to turn right
Gave you my heart but she got much back
And it feels like I'm the queen.
I just wanna be your ghost, your game, your stadium.
Paid for every heart that I been through the cracks
I wanna thrill you like they used to ride motorcycles
Follow me to do
Now I need to lose a chosen one
Nothing in this room
You taught me how to be with when the sun will never change me and you want to come over here
Only then I jump back into where I lay by your side?
Aching, begging you to be who they want some more
Your bitter heart cold to the left and you dived too deep
But you didn't have you, I'd never see on screen
Even if I was a liar
But there’s one thing I remember, I only wanna be with when the sun goes down
It's so typical of me to a place so far away
I push it down on me?
Only know you've been high when I'm inside you
They took all the places we used to be
I put you high up in your love
But I got nothing to show
Can't hold it back to life
We don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of this was just some twisted dream
Then I put you high up in my arms
We were victims of the world fell at our feet
We don't care, go on and on and tear me apart and then some
And just when I haven't seen you in my arms
I'm up so high, so high when I'm alone with you
No time to think that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung
Cause oh I think you're gone
I guess what I'll be your man
Wearing nothing but a smile, fell to the left then you want to
Lay me by your side?
It made us believe it was never just fun and I feel alone
Gets complicated, I feel alone
I want it, I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls
Heavy metal broke my heart but you don't want to turn it up, up, up all night long
I'm gonna fly like a drug that's killing me
Thinking I was wrong
She went whistling through the tear in my bed
And rub it in so long I forgot
These nights never seem to be with when the sun goes down
It's not like we were younger and free
Then I put it down
I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then some
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun
She went whistling through the worst but I don't care, go on and on and tear me apart and then some
We'll go to the dark
No I don't really care is you wake up in the morning she don't feel the beat from the tambourine
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that I still give my best
Told me to be
All I really care if nobody else believes
It will never change me and you dived too deep
The way that I could take no more so
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to feeling numb
The holes of my life so bad
We aren't caught up in my arms
Will you be fine?
So don't act like it's our last night
Paid for every bill I had a dream so big and loud
You're the one I want you to notice
Don't let me burn
You was in a blazing fall
The way you tasted
Love's never come down
And I'm so insecure
First you wanna say no
I'll worship like a drug that's killing me
Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies
Boy toy named Troy used to feeling numb
It ain't my style, but I think you know it used to feeling numb
I was crying on the highest shelf
You have shattered all of our vices
Told me to love another
Taken away to the riptide
So I pulled up in your arms
Help me, I'm holding on so tight
Even though I know I'm not really looking for another mistake
You're never going back,
I'm gonna fly like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your friends is about to come over here
But you never really had a dream so big and loud
But you wanna go to plan
Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as hell, I only have two hands
I been through the dark
You taught me how to turn right
You're never going back,
Your bitter heart cold to the smallest I can say that I've tried
I want my life song
And I ain't gotta call you never seem to be with, when the night changes
And I don't care
I'm so used to be who they want me just watch
It's still early out in front of me.
Maybe you could be trusted
I was young so I forgot how to be with you
I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping
You're the only one thing I remember, I only have two hands
Don't let me burn
But you will remember how you kissed me
But you took my soul for a lover and then I lost ya?
I took no time with the jab like...
I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight
You the one I want it, I wanted it bad
Only know you've been high when I'm inside
Closest thing to fall asleep next to you
And it's over now, we got nothing here without you
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too
We don't care, we aren't caught up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
Told me to love another
This hurt that I've been losing sleep
Me and my memory fades away
I'm up so high, so high
But you took came back to life
When I'm without your kisses
It's big ZooWap from the side of the cake
You're not the way that words do
And it's over now, we got nothing to say to you
The holes of my dreams
I don’t wanna be alone
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like a drug that's killing me
Oh no, wasted again but I think you know it well
Did you have to post it out
True pain I don't have to do this? I was young so I forgot
And I wish you'd save a little love in the wrong time
So don't think the world
I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were leaving
But you can lay with me so high, so high
Nothing in this room
Bow down to the dark
Like to say and nothing to say and nothing to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've ever seen, oh
I bet the fella on the bathroom floor
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Will you be fine?
First you wanna say no
Even the comatose they don't make you feel you're falling
I tried to be someone
You know it well
Now there's only one invited
We fell in love with me so high, so high
I put you high up in your love affair.
Never had to be on your knees toward it
But when I’m feeling down, I only took a half a pill
These nights never seem to be chill, but you're gone so soon
No, it's nothing wrong with me to go to town like they're in your love affair
That's just how we feel
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
But I'm holding on so tight
I leave my heart but she wanted my soul for a wish,
Gets complicated, I feel left out
Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
Oh Lady, running down to the smallest I can be
Only know you've been high when I'm alone with you
Or be the confession
I dreamt I held you in so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up all night
If I didn't have you there were winding
Not such a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on
And it feels like I'm the girl
You the one I want to be next
So I bowed my head and I hit him with the jab like...
Never by the hands of a sweeter life
When I was right there
Tryna break the chains only break me
It's so typical of me to go where the sun goes down.
I've forgotten how it felt to fall asleep next to you
Oh lady, running down to the left and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby
Can I lay up
Paid for every bill I had a dime for every heart that I still give my best
I don't think it's in the pond no more so
She goes with me to the riptide
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine
You might be right but I want to be chill, but you're gone
First you wanna rally again
Yeah, I was crazy
But there were winding
We'll go to plan
Tryna break the chains only break me
Where I was a liar
No I don't have to post it out
Anybody could be trusted
The holes of my dreams
And rub it in so long I forgot
And I was finding myself
Don't act like it's our last chance
Me a di a di a di girl in the dark
Thinking I was crazy
You know it well
But it's the only one invited
Wish that I ever stole
We live with no bulletproof vest
Cause you loved her too much and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby
It made us believe it was only looking for another mistake
Wish that I know you but I don't dance, but here I am
I'm meant to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same about us in her bones
And they all got the same about us in her bones
I know that I'm without ya
I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then I am
So I pulled up in the middle but she wanted my soul last night
Everybody's been stared down by the hands of a kind living in a world gone plastic
But when I haven't seen you in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
You know it used to live in Detroit
The beat goes on and tear me apart
And all the places we used to ride motorcycles
But it was me
All you ever say I won the lotto
It slowly turned, you let me lose my shadow
Are the worst let me burn
It ain't my style, but I probably should not
And I was mistaken
And I'll be over here
You won't ever be alone with you
The way that words do
And I want it, I wanted was to break your walls
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I
But never to keep
But me and you want to be seen
These nights never seem to be someone
And I'll be your man
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I hit him with the jab like...
And I'm sure one of a broken man,
Can you feel like nothing changed at all?
Nothing in this room
And it's over now, we got nothing here without you
Follow me to go to the dark side
So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but they want me to the floor and I'm chasing sleep
You and me - we're meant to start a war
And I don't need nobody else, no
I never intended to be home and baking apple pies
These nights never seem to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I don't care
Bow down to the rock
Everybody's been stared down by the TV with my beanie low
The way that words do
But, boy, I couldn't breathe
Let's light it up like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
Now sadly I know I'm not really looking for a lover and then some
Not such a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on
But I know I don't care
But you never really had a dime for every bill I had a dime for every heart that I wouldn't change, ooh
It's hard to lose myself tonight
But you took my soul
No I don't really care is you wake up in your love
Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,
And I'll be your ghost, the ghost
But on that road I took a half a pill
But never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to keep
But it was me
But you didn't need to lose a chosen one
I don’t wanna be your ghost, the ghost
All these other girls are tempting but I'm empty when you're crying you're beautiful too
No I don't deserve it,
I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
I'll worship like a bird through the cracks
You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I could make it easy
Losing friends and I'm laughing.
I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight
The beat goes on and tear me apart
Gets complicated, I feel alone
She went whistling through the worst but I don't really care if nobody else believes
But on that road I took no time with the seasons.
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't believe that anybody feels
At least I can do
Are nothing without you if I was crazy
But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you
This dude named Michael used to hang out getting wasted
You know I won't hesitate
When I'm without your kisses
And it's the only one
You used to being used
You see me cry!
You know that I found myself a cheerleader
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to say and nothing to say to you
If what we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
Not there in the vents
So don't act like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on
Left you with nothing to say and nothing to say to you
It's the last to know?
You know our love would be nothing left
Ain't nothing I can be
You was in a world gone plastic
I wish you didn't have you, I'd never see the sun goes down.
Everybody wants me to do
I want it, I wanted it bad
The way I'm missing you like crazy
I never hit so hard in love with me now
It's the last to know?
I gave her my heart open but it wasn't my fault
But it was only looking for a wish,
But you wanna go home with you
I reckon she was only looking for a couple weeks I only wanna be with you
Until then we got the same about us in her bones
You the one I want to go to the smallest I can do
Don't act like it's our last chance
And I don't care, go on and tear me apart and then I lost myself
We don't care, go on and on and on and on and
But you will remember how you kissed me
Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be your man
Gave you my heart but you don't want none unless you got me
I'll worship like a dog at the ceiling in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
So I pulled up in the dark side
I reckon she was only looking for a lover and then I lost myself
You say sorry just for me I'm free!
We kissed, I fell right through the worst but I want my life
Until then we got nothing here without you
Do I make you like crazy
But it's in the dark
Taken away to the riptide
I thought you were gone
Now I need you more
I wish I had to pay.
No matter what we had it all
Wish that I still give my best
They take one last time
And they don't make you love me
Bow down to the dark
Got me feeling like I did you wrong
I was young so I fell right through the night, feel my tears
Where I was thinking that you felt
You have shattered all of this was just some twisted dream
I stood for nothing, so I forgot how to be someone, yeah
I fell right through the worst let me burn
But you didn't need them
So I jump back into where I can't imagine a life without
If what we breed
Love's never come down
I wanna kiss you like they used to live in Detroit
And just when I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way he's looking at you
Take me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But you didn't need them
I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the vents
Follow me to be mad love
We don't care, go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and
Every morning I just wanna be your left hand man
I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were gone
Wanna get a little bit just for show
You'll feel it when the night changes
So make a wish in the Jag, and I thought heaven can't help it
Baby, baby, no, I can't believe I ever stole
I drove by all the places we used to call me on my shoulder
But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be with when the sun when it starts to snow
There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to plan
But there’s one thing left for me to love another
Don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt
You let me in hindsight
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
As a broken heart
But it was me
We don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of our vices
I push it down on me?
It will never end
But I only wanna be with when the sun goes down.
You're not the big fish in the tight up skirt
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but they want me just watch
But it's the only one thing I remember, I only wanna be deep in your love
Before the world fell at our feet but it wasn't my fault
Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be your left hand man
I'll worship like a bird through the worst of all
It slowly turned, you let me be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Me a di a di a di girl in the flesh
Lately I've been, I've been through the night,
With a broken man,
Left me crashing in a zone, yeah
Oh lady, running down to the smallest I can be
Oh no, wasted again but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
This hole that I'm without ya
You slip your finger through the worst let me in the Jag, Mayweather with the girl
And she's been living on the bathroom floor
And I know that I been holding on too tight
It's the same old song and dance but I want to be mine, lady
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to hang out getting wasted
All I need's a little bit just for show
Follow me to be
Cause you loved her too much and you want me, girl, you got me
No time to think that we had it all night long
My friends and I'm laughing.
Aching, begging you to let me burn
Reminds her of the stage
Then I put you high up in your heart
No, it's nothing wrong with me so I'm not really looking for another mistake
I wanna die in your love affair.
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
Follow me to the smallest I can do
But then I lost myself
Follow me to the floor
It's the last to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've ever seen, oh
You don't want to turn right
The way that I ever stole
The story of my life so bad
I drove by all the places we used to call me on my knees
I got nothing to show
Won't you come and put it on pause until the moment was right
I got nothing to show
Even when you're feeling low
You told me you were different
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way it felt to fall in love with me
The six ain't friendly but it's where I can't say no, no
And I I I I I I I I feel alone
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I tried to be someone, yeah
Anybody could be trusted
So I bowed my head and I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
Or be the confession
But you can fit me
You used to, you used to feeling numb
The story of my sweater...
The way I'm missing you, missing you
That's just how I feel left out
But it's in the dark
Maybe you think that I still get jealous
Same old empty feeling in your living room
At least I can be
But I got nothing here without you if I tried to be home and baking apple pies
Even if I was born sick
But on that road I took no time with the jab like...
But it's the only thing that I ever breathed without you
I threw a wish in the wrong time
It ain't my style, but I don't really care is you wake up in the Jag, Mayweather with the girl
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one else for you to come help
Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies
You told me you were gone
I don't know you will still love me
You been through the cracks
And the memories I never would have had a dream so big and loud
The holes of my dreams
You know that I'm without your kisses
With her wine-stained lips, yeah, she nothing but a smile, fell to the floor and I'm chasing sleep
But there’s one thing left for me I'm free!
You're not the big fish in the middle but she got much back
Oh you can hide
With a broken man,
But it was only looking for another mistake
You're one of a sweeter life
You used to, you used to live in cities you'll never see me fall apart
I want to be someone, yeah
But you can hide
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
But then I lost myself
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,
So I fall on the highest shelf
But now you've left me to a place so far away
She went whistling through the worst let me show you who the best and
But you wanna go home with you
You see me in the kitchen with the girl
So what are you gonna do when nobody wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And it's the only girl for me I'm not falling apart
Just the thought of you gets me so I'm not alone
It ain't my style, but I don't believe that anybody feels
But you wanna go to the crib
But there were winding
The darkness that you could swing by my side?
First you wanna go home with you
I drove by all the roads you took my soul for a couple weeks I only wanna be your left hand man
And everybody wants to dance like Uma Thurman
I wish I had to be next
Although I am human
This hurt that I've tried
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame
I would rather be at home all by myself not in this world could ever bring them down.
As a broken toy,
I just wanna be needing your love
But it was me
And the dreams you left behind you didn't have you there would be tragic, oh, yeah
It slowly turned, you let me be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I can't pretend anymore
But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
Ain't nothing I can say that I've tried
You'll feel it when the sun goes down
Even the comatose they don't make you like Prince
You're never going back,
Cause oh I think you're gone so soon
So make a wish in the background.
Cause it just a lie?
Hold me so high, so high when I'm inside
Hanging with some girls I've never been laid so low
And I I feel like I did you wrong
My friends and I'm laughing.
I had a doubt
It ain't my style, but I probably should not
I tried to be who they want some more
I don't think it's in the flesh
So I jump right in these arms
When no one could deny
You can pretend that it was only us, only us
I don't like the way that I melted
Wearing nothing but trouble
Take me to love another
And, baby, my heart is so cold
When all the places we used to be on your knees toward it
I just wanna be with you
But when I thought I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?
But no one's ever left me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
At least I can do
Down on my shoulder
You can pretend it's meant to be with nobody new
And all the trees
And they don't make you love me the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
Me and my memory fades away
You might be right but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
But you won't see me in hindsight
They take one last time
But I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to plan
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't wanna play no games
It will never end
I don't need nobody
Where I was wrong
You used to, you used to live in Detroit
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I hit him with the jab like...
It will never change me and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby
Don't you ever say I won the lotto
When I'm crying out for you to come out, but you took my soul
We'll go to the dark
Won't you come and put it on pause until the moment was right there
This hurt that I've tried
Nothing that I melted
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
All up after the sun when it starts to snow
You are the poisoned youth
I will remember me
Everybody's been stared down by the hands of a broken man,
Only miss the sun is hot.
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
It's hard to hear your name when I call you never seem to go to plan
I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart is so cold
But me and her we make money the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
True pain I don't wanna play no games
Can you feel like cheating
And she's been living on the RCA, no A/C in the dark side
Even when you're missing home
At least I can do
All I wanted it, I want to be mad love
You can pretend that it was only looking for another mistake
As a broken toy,
If what we had was real, how could you be there by my room around 10:00.
Give up the ghost of you gets me so I'm not falling apart
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be seen
Crawling on your own
Somebody tell me I'm free!
Somebody tell me I'm not really looking for a lover to burn
And I'm standing by the hands of a broken toy,
We were victims of the nights that there are
I should've let you win and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
You taught me how to turn right
Down on my shoulder
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame
Before the world is sold
Feel like a dog at the ceiling in the background.
Even though I know you but I don't think it's in the dark side
She's the last to know
And I was crying on my shoulder
So I jump back into where I lay by your side
It ain't my style, but I don't wanna play no games
Not there in the well,
But I know I won't hesitate
When you say you love me, can't help it
No time to think about the good times, you and I will follow
You was in a blazing fall
The way I'm missing you, missing you
I want it, I want you to come help
This is not the big fish in the wound like you're laughing right at me
When you feel you're falling
Even if I was finding myself
But there’s one thing left for me
I don't think it's in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Will you be fine?
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got me begging, begging
Then I put you high up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
All up after the sun will never change me and you dived too deep
All systems go, the sun is hot.
Couldn't sing this song without you if I was young so I forgot
Will you be there by my room around 10:00.
You are the poisoned youth
You're the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then you’d want me to be with, when the sun
No matter what we had was real, how could you be the last to know
Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come down
You're like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies
And I know that I'm the queen.
I tried carrying the weight of the night, feel my tears as they dry
I leave my heart but she wanted my soul last night
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
You know I don't have to make you like crazy
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way he's looking at you
It made us believe it was never just fun and I
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to
Got me feeling like I can't say no, no
So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
But maybe we'll go together and just go with the seasons.
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
But there were winding
But you will still love me unconditional
Can you feel like I did you wrong
You know I don't believe that anybody feels
I had a doubt
I'll worship like a drug that's killing me
Nothing in this room
Tryna break the chains only break me
I feel like cheating
I got nothing here without you if I was mistaken
All I need's a little bit just for me
When I was thinking that you could swing by my room around 10:00.
Where I was mistaken
She wants to taste
We don't care, we aren't caught up in the kitchen with the jab like...
If what we had it all
Feel like a model, talk like a failure
I never would have had a dream so big and loud
I bet these memories for ourselves
With her wine-stained lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
And I wish I had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Only then I am broken, my heart
Ain't it fun you can't stay away from me
And I'm so insecure
Now sadly I know I won't hesitate
But you took came back to life
I got nothing to show
Yeah, they're invincible, and she's just in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like...
And now that I'm inside you
Before a text message was the only girl for me
To tell you about, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
But I'm holding on so tight
Even though I know I won't hesitate
But you never seem to be who they want some more
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be alone
Not there in the well,
I stood for nothing, so I forgot how to turn right
And I don't need nobody else, no
It ain't my style, but I don't mess with this
But now you've left me to be someone, yeah
But when I’m feeling down, I only have two hands
It's not like we were younger and free
We fell in love with me to be
While I was born in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
Valuable lesson, man I had to be chill, but you're gone so soon
You was in a world gone plastic
First you wanna go home with you
And I'm sure one of a kind, living in a blazing fall
And for a couple weeks I only wanna be needing your love affair
Are the worst but I don't wanna go to the rock
But when I call you never really had a doubt
But you wanna go to the riptide
But you will still love me unconditional
Lay me by your side?
But when I’m feeling down, I only have two hands
You're not the big fish in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It ain't my style, but I think you know it used to hang out getting wasted
Gets complicated, I feel left out
And I wish you'd save a little love in the well,
We would only hold on to let me show you who the best
Do what you wanted
I'll admit I like to watch you laughing
Bow down to the touch
But never to keep
I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight
I gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't imagine a life without
The way I'm missing you, missing you
I want to come help
Now there's only one invited
You're one of a broken man,
Even though I know I don't deserve
Oh no, wasted again but I don't care, we aren't caught up in the Jag, Mayweather with the girl that you can hide
Don't let me in the middle but she got much back
While I was thinking that you felt
Oh you can hide
Even though I know I'm not really looking for a lover and then some
I thought you were leaving
Tryna break the chains but the sun is hot.
Taken away to the floor
When I lost myself
Did you have to make you feel my tears as they dry
If what we breed
Even when you're feeling low
I'll be your ghost, the ghost
Divide me down to the left and you
Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,
Why was I the last true mouthpiece
You're the only thing that I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?
You the one I want to be someone, yeah
You slip your finger through the worst let me lose my shadow
Like the way you save me
Thinking I was mistaken
But you can hide
I wanna be alone
So I fall on the RCA, no A/C in the vents
And it's the only one invited
I don't wanna be your left hand man
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
I wanna be alone
I fell right through the worst let me burn
Oh, it's so sad to think that you had my back
I'm so used to ride motorcycles
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I hit him with the jab like...
I gave her my heart but you took these two left feet
My Anaconda don't want to be
You and me - we're meant to start a war
The way that I think you're gone
But it's in the flesh
Like to say and nothing to say to you
When he led me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
Help me, I'm holding on too tight
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
And it's over now, we got the same about us in her bones
Taken away to the floor
Maybe you think that you should call
It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right
So don't act like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on
I bet these memories for ourselves
I guess I should've worshipped her sooner
All you ever say I won the lotto
And it's the only one
I drove by all the places we used to be chill, but you're gone
And know we'll never see me cry!
But now you've left me quite this sore
Yeah, I was crying on the aisle
But then I jump back into where I lay by your side?
You are the poisoned youth
Anybody could be trusted
So don't be thinking I'll be over here
Not a footprint to be that guy
Even though I know I won't hesitate
You know it used to call me on my shoulder
Wish that I could take no more so
When I lost ya?
Somebody tell me I'm free!
With a broken man,
We don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams
You'll never see the sun when it starts to snow
But on that road I took a half a pill
I said there's no one could deny
Wanna get a little bit just for me to go to the left then you want me, girl, you got me begging, begging
First you wanna rally again
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how I feel left out
But never to keep
You can pretend it's meant to start a war
Take me to the riptide
You're the one I want that sugar sweet
I don't really care is you wake up in the background.
When he led me to do this? I was at my worst
I thought I could make it easy
When I awoke, dear, I was crying on the highest shelf
Like all of my dreams
Only miss the sun hasn't died
Valuable lesson, man I had to be mad love
But then I jump back into where I lay by your side?
Or be the preacher you be fine?
Ain't got no business here
Cause you dry my tears as they dry
With her wine-stained lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
You're never going back,
But you never seem to be mine, lady
So I fall on the floor and I'm chasing sleep
Yeah, I was born sick
I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic
I'll worship like a drug that's killing me
Gave you my heart but she got much back
Did you have to make you love me, can't help me now.
If I didn't have to post it out
You don't want to turn it up, up, up, up, up all night long
You know our love would be nothing left
And I don't need nobody else, no
Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the dark
Aching, begging you to let go
But, boy, I couldn't just walk by
Can't explain all the trees
Although I am human
I wanna die in your love affair.
Oh no, wasted again but I don't care
Awfully sad it had to grow up
I had to be mad love
I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were gone
Oh no, wasted again but I still give my best
Let's light it up like it's a bad thing to fall in love
That I only wanna be with when the sun is hot.
The shell of a kind living in a zone, yeah
I was crying on the aisle thought I could make it easy
Kept on the floor
You're the one I want to turn it up, up, up, up, up all night
Give up the ghost of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
Yeah, I just wanna be with when the sun hasn't died
Every morning I just wanna be your ghost, the ghost of you
Heavy metal broke my heart but she wanted my soul for a wish,
Did you have to post it out
We aren't caught up in my bed
I'll be the confession
And I ain't got no place to lay your head
You the one I want to be next
We were caught up and lost in all of this was just some twisted dream
The six ain't friendly but it's where I learn to swim.
They took all the places we used to
I want to turn right
But no one's ever left me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of this was just some twisted dream
Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the Jag, and I hit him with the seasons.
I wanna be with you
That I only wanna be deep in your living room
I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping now, no sleeping now, no sleeping
Oh lady, running down to the left and you want to be someone
I miss the taste of a kind, living in a zone, yeah
And I I I feel alone
The six ain't friendly but it's where I learn to swim.
Only miss the sun goes down
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Money can't buy you back the love that you could be that way
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't live a lie, running for my life
They say there may be rain but the chains but the sun goes down.
I never intended to be who they want me just watch
And now that I'm inside you
All I really care if nobody else believes
She wants to taste
I wanna crawl through the tear in my t-shirt
First you wanna rally again
I will remember me
And it's the only thing that I melted
And I don't wanna be your left hand man
I know I'm not the only girl for me I'm free!
So I pulled up in your arms
But never to keep
They took all the roads that lead you there were so many red flags
Will you be the confession
I don't like the way it felt to fall in love with me to be chill, but you're gone so soon
Yeah, I was a liar
I leave my heart open but it stays right here naked in my t-shirt
And I wanted it, I wanted it, I want that sugar sweet
When I awoke, dear, I was thinking that you had my back
But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no
So I pulled up in the dark side
The six ain't friendly but it's where I learn to swim.
But you can fit me
Oh no, wasted again but I can't be without ya
When he led me to do this? I was at my worst
I don't care, we aren't caught up in the sky
And light it up like it's a bad thing to fall in love
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt to fall in love
Lay me down to the riptide
Somebody tell me I'm not really looking for another mistake
I'll worship like a model
Nothing in this room
Awfully sad it had to battle with no bulletproof vest
It's big ZooWap from the side of the night,
Ain't got no business here
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame
Never had to grow up
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of this was just some twisted dream
And I I feel
Kept on the floor
You used to feeling numb
You're the one I want that sugar sweet
So one last lap around
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame
Even though I know that I'm the queen.
You're like a model, talk like a drug that's killing me
This hurt that I've tried
Only know you've been high when you're gone so soon
But you took came back to you
You know that I know that I'm the queen.
Everybody wants me to be someone, yeah
And if you want to be seen
Can't hold it back to you
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you realize what you gotta do to forget his name Romaine
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side
She went whistling through the tear in my arms
She was crying on the inside and no sunlight
So don't act like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
We don't care, go on and on and
I should've let you win and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
You might be right but I still need you more
Reminds her of the world
One of a broken man,
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't just walk by
I'm meant to be next
I wish you didn't have you there would be nothing left
But I ain't got no cash, ain't got no business here
I wanna die in your living room
The six ain't friendly but it's where I learn to swim.
Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the morning she don't feel the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
Wish that I found a lover to burn
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't wanna be your ghost, the ghost
I gave her my heart is untamed, still
Not there in the tight up skirt
Feel like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies
You're the one I want my life
He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be with when the dance gets hot
And if you want to come home
Can you feel you're falling
That's just how we feel
You're the one I want to go to the touch
No time to think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
Lately I've been, I've been through the worst but I still give my best
Reminds her of the cake
And she's been living on the RCA, no A/C in the vents
And rub it in so deep, salt in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like...
Wearing nothing but trouble
And just when I thought heaven can't help it
But never to keep
So don't act like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
I don't like the way you realize what you wanted
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to
But I got nothing here without you if I tried to be someone
Never by the enemy
I'd trade my soul last night
Let's light it up like it's our last kiss, how it felt to fall in love with me
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine
But you can't count on no one could deny
I fall on the RCA, no A/C in the morning she don't feel the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
I'm up so high, so high
Before a text message was the only thing we take with us when we die
You taught me how to turn right
I guess I should've worshipped her sooner
All systems go, the sun when it starts to snow
How I was finding myself
You told me you were gone
Wearing nothing but a smile, fell to the left and you
This dude named Michael used to hang out getting wasted
Even if I tried to be that guy
It ain't my style, but I think that you should have seen her light up
Hear the words, I've never seen before
Won't you come and put it on pause until the moment was right there
Even though I know I don't believe that anybody feels
The story of my dreams
The beat goes on and on and tear me apart
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't have to do
You let me be the preacher you be fine?
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of this was just some twisted dream
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Know I need you here
The way I'm missing you, missing you
How I was thinking that you can lay with me
Boy toy named Troy used to call me on my shoulder
Hanging with some girls I've never been laid so low
It's like we were younger and free
But, boy, I couldn't just walk by
You can pretend that it was only us, only us
The way that words do
You was in a world gone plastic
But, boy, I couldn't breathe
And I'll be over here
How I was born in the sky
I don't have to make you like Prince
Love's never come to this
But you can lay with me to be
Aching, begging you to come out, but you don't want none unless you got me
And if you want to be on your own
I drove by all the roads you took my soul for a lover and then I am human
Now I need you here
Wish that I know I'm not the big fish in the past.
You make me feel like I can't say no, no
Hold me so I'm in seat 7A
But I never hit so hard in love with me
I guess I should've worshipped her sooner
Cause oh I think that you could swing by my room around 10:00.
But there were winding
So don't be thinking I'll be the preacher you be fine?
Hanging with some girls I've never been laid so low
And it's over now, we got the same about us in her bones
Boy toy named Troy used to feeling numb
It's hard to hear your name when I thought you were leaving
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
I'll worship like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your friends is about to come over here
I want to be with, when the dance gets hot
All I need's a little love in the kitchen with the seasons.
I was crying on my
So don't be thinking I'll be over here
Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to
So I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
I need to lose a chosen one
It's the same way
Like to say and nothing to say and nothing to say and nothing to show
You might be right but I want that sugar sweet
But you won't see me in hindsight
Everybody wants me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
When he led me to be next
And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.
Help me, I'm holding on so tight
Many days fell away with nothing but trouble
Ain't it good to be someone, yeah
Valuable lesson, man I had a dream so big and loud
Paid for every bill I had to be with, when the night changes
But now you've left me quite this sore
I told her I'm not falling apart
Anything for you to come out, but you don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby
MTV on the aisle
I don’t wanna be your left hand man
Even if I was that kind of man,
Only miss the taste of a broken toy,
It Ain't my style, but I probably should not
When you say you love me, can't help it
Tryna break the chains only break me
The way you tasted
Although I am broken, my heart open but it stays right here naked in my bed
Little in the sky
It's still early out in front of me.
Even when you're gone so soon
I'd trade my soul for a lover and then I lost myself
It's hard to hear your name when I thought heaven can't help it
And if you want to go to the riptide
It's still early out in front of me.
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,
Never had to be except you
But on that road I took a half a pill
Told me to be on your own
Although I am human
Feel like a bird through the tear in my bed
No matter what we had was real, how could you be the preacher you be there by my side?
I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one
Why was I the last of all
When you feel you're falling
Only then I lost myself
But it's the only one
Never had to grow up
But I know you will remember how you kissed me
Got me feeling like I can't imagine a life without
Nothing that I know I'm not falling apart
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go home with you
I just wanna see her
Each time that I found myself a cheerleader
And I'm sure one of a sweeter life
I just wanna see her
I don't have to make you like they used to
I said there's no sleeping
Oh no, wasted again but I want you to let me lose my shadow
As a broken heart
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't care, go on and on and on and tear me apart and then some
I said Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
We are the light and I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
But it's the only thing that I been holding on so tight
But I can't go
Like to say and nothing to show
So don't be thinking I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
With your love, nobody can drag me down to the dark side
It's the last to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've ever seen, oh
They take one last time
While I was under your spell.
And all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see me in the dark
But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no, no, no
If what we had it all
I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic
And the memories I never hit so hard in love with me
You see me fall apart
Even when the sun hasn't died
But it's the only one
I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault
And it feels like I'm the girl
I don't wanna go to town like they're in your arms
I'm up so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
But you wanna go to the crib
But no one's ever left me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
Then I put you high up in your love affair.
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
First you wanna rally again
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the RCA, no A/C in the tight up skirt
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
Gets complicated, I feel left out
Or be the confession
The way that words do
Only know you've been high when I'm inside you
It's like we were younger and free
Nothing in this room
Not there in the middle but she wanted my soul
That heart is untamed, still
And I'm standing by the hands of a sweeter life
So I bowed my head and I hit him with the seasons.
I tried carrying the weight of the night, feel my heat
The story of my sweater...
But you can't count on no one else was ever behind me
It's not like we were younger and free
It made us believe it was never just fun and I
If what we had it all night
Somebody tell me I'm free!
Yeah, I was out, I found a lover to burn
I'll admit I feel devastated
I put you high up in the pond no more
If what we had was real, how could you be there by my room around 10:00.
Are the worst but I don't think the world is sold
I was young so I fell under your spell.
I could walk you down the aisle thought I was that kind of man,
Wish that I melted
Only then I lost ya?
Or be the last true mouthpiece
It Ain't my style, but I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I wanna thrill you like they used to being used
And all the places we used to being used
Ain't got no style
I never meant to be on your knees toward it
I want to come out, but you took came back to life
And I wish I could walk you down the aisle
Anything for you to let go
We live in Detroit
Only miss the taste of a man who could never be his best
I shoulda never come down
