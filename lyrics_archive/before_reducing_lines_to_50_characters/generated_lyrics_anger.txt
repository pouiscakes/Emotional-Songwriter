You can tell me why, why you do, ooh
If you're gonna stay
Let me take you long
No, I don't listen to
Give me all of me
Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again
We work too damn hard for this just to give it up now and face the sun goes
Whistle past the breaking point
For the haters out there, you can let the light in
I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my feet
If I got all the tables turn
But leave me hanging, hanging
Every time that you take me high
Maybe there's a way out of my blood
Somewhere with my people we can leave the night on
You know I won't be no one-night stand
If it's wrong I don't plan to take over the planet
Fight for yours and don't let them compare you, no
You light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my cell phone
I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,
They tell me when it's burning low
Well, you can bite this
But I don't really know what I'm saying y'all
With this boy who's hollering I can smell your scent from miles
Don't keep it just one more time
But something to smoke
Every time you are out them clothes
And people ask me how to dougie
With this boy who's hollering I can make all the lights that light the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
Don't you know you're trying to do
Turning me on my apples
Written on these walls are the one I want her
When you get stuck on
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
Go ahead and tell everybody what I'm supposed to heal it over time
From your head yes
If you wanna say
All I know people make promises all the right junk in all the tables turn
She is always right there when I need to make you understand
That talk too much to say
It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Time that you take my hand in my head above it as best I can.
Don't you know you're trying to get back
Don't have a little something
Don't have a little unimpressed with this
Yeah you can let the light when it's burning low
If you wanna run away but your eyes
Why you always have to be the one I want to want me to chill
With what you say
She will go away
Let me take you long
No, I'm just playing, I know when that hotline bling
You're over my head forever stuck
If you want to either
They all know why I'm not insane
We jumped never asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy
You pick me up when it's over
And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no sleep, I guess that I never ask for every Sunday
She's always right there when I need to make you understand
Don't you know that I don't wanna steal your freedom
Here I give you something that you are out them clothes
And I let you go
Finna give you up
Truth is that I could be like the cool kids.
We about to get what you want
Don't you know you're trying to do
Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.
I need to complicate.
How many times do I have to be the outcast
Give me all of me
The bruises on your lips
Omi make me kill one of the world,
And if I seem uninterested
Turning me on my feet
And I can’t get her off my chest
And I can't stop we're enemies
For the haters out there, you can let the light when it's burning low
I took it right in my corner right there when I say I don't dance
This is my destiny
I don't plan to let you push me past the graveyard
Don't it always seem to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Even if it's torture
Before the cool kids,
But I can make all the time
And if I seem uninterested
But I can't change
I wish that I can't sweep you off of your feet
I let you go
I hear your voice in my phone number
I can still hear you lie tonight
No I won't hesitate
I wish I had some time just to give it up now
And my kiss on your thighs like my fingerprints
Disappearing when you fall asleep
You pick me up inside
We work too damn hard for this just to give it up now and face the sun goes
You're over my head spinning, no kidding, I can't explain
And this is my fight song
I'm standoffish, don't want ya
That's why I should never make a fuss
Never start no static I just can’t get over you
We jumped never asking why I'm getting drunk on a couch
And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no peace
And I won't hesitate
When you don't want to want me to stay, oh why,
Then another one bites the dust settled around us
Don't keep it steady
No, I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,
Just think while you've been getting down and keep it just one more time
Trying to reach the things that I can't have it any other way
All that's left to do to me at all!
When I say I don't want me to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
I stay out too late if I'm honest
They won't let this end
And I don't get along
You're the only thing I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the slow lane
Party girls don't get along
The pictures that you moan
They won't let this end
Here I give you up
Put my finger on a plane
Boys only want love if it's just in your
I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
And all the right places
How many times do I have to be with when the times get rough
We about to get back
You can tell everybody what I'm saying y'all
And all the right places
Well you see her when you leave me
They say the words
But just give it up for you just say the words
No I won't ever let you under my skin
We about to get a little unimpressed with this
Cause I can't explain
Go ahead and tell everybody what I'm supposed to heal it over time
Be the good times
So you can ring anybody's bell to get a little tangled up right about now
If you wanna say
Just think while you've been getting down and keep it steady
She's always right there when I want her
And when the sun goes
Call me on my feet is open wide
Over this music I don't want ya
Girl, you're the one thing, one thing
You see her when you say you need from it
The bruises on your tongue
Like a finger on a film with you
Put my finger on your thighs like my fingerprints
Whistle past the breaking point
Nobody cares how fast we go crashing down, we come back every time
The bruises on your lips
Their skin in craters like the cool kids
Take all of the world,
Baby, why don't you tell me I'm too young to understand
Disappearing when you fall asleep
Now another one bites the dust settled around us
I let you go
Don't it always seem to go home, we can leave the night on
And all the right junk in all the lights that lead us there are blinding
I wanna save that light the way
Over this music I don't wanna get with you and sit on a couch
I wipe my brow and I don't want to either
Can you hear that sound
Here I stand though
They tell me when it's burning low
If you don't pay it, don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
Don't you know that I could be like the moon
And his voice is too loud
Did you have to tell you about, no
Love me or hate me we just don't get angry at the fan
Every time that you are out them clothes
Trying to get what you wanna say
I hear your voice is too loud
Well, you can keep me
I don't get along
And I don't listen to
We jumped never asking why I'm getting drunk on a loaded gun
How could every day something jumps in the dirty south, yeah
Baby, why don't you let me stop by?
And we'll start a riot
With what you wanna dance,
Maybe some part of you just for a second,
No matter what you need me
And if I seem uninterested
And the next thing you know you're trying to get you out my mind
Disappearing when you say
You're never gonna be a homebody
Give your all to charity
I'm standoffish, don't want me
She's always in my pants
Disappearing when you fall asleep
Give me spots on my cell phone
If you take me high
And all the time
When the lights that light
They tell me to stay, oh why,
Take another, I don't care if you close your eyes,
Well you're the pain
Every time you are out them clothes
Turning me on my feet is burning bright
They won't let this end
I let you down
If you want to want me to stay, oh why,
And I don't wanna get you out them clothes
When I say I don't dance, don't ask, I don't plan to take over the planet
Then I'ma slow it back to you
Boys only want love if it's just pretend
I don't wanna get you out them clothes
Is you really fake
To pay off all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy
Oh why can I say I don't want what you're offering
Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again
Whistle past the breaking point
You are the stories that I could be like the cool done run out
Give me spots on my cell phone
I can still hear you lie tonight
I'd rather put on a loaded gun
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted
No matter what you say you need me
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry if I stay out too late
From you hear that sound
Say whatever what you need me
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
There's no need to move, I need motivation, my one solution
Take another, I don't want what you're offering
You wanna make a fuss
Written in these walls are the one I want her
They tell me when it's burning low
So you can let the light when it's all over
No, I don't dance
Makes you wanna dance
You used to before
Give your all to charity
Backin up a parking lot
Gotta get you drunk
Why you always have to tell you I'm straight
Your intentions aren't to bother you but
And all the tables turn
I'm standoffish, don't want you to stop
Did you have to cross that line
And when it rains and pours, and then you're gone
You could've been getting down and keep it just to give it up now and face the sun goes
I get drunk on a loaded gun
Every time that you are not around
Give me all of you just say the shoe can always fit, no matter what you say
Put your money where your mouth still remember the taste of my mind
That's why I never meant for you just hates me
Truth is that you moan?
Well, I'll just keep on blowing up my phone number
Well, you can keep me
No, I'm just playing, I know they wind right back to you
Don't keep it steady
Can you hear my voice, you hear my voice it's no secret
All I wanna touch
I'd do anything with you on my cell phone
I'm like a lady
You're so indecisive of what I'm supposed to say
I just wanna get you out of my head forever stuck
Open up your mind
Try to keep my head spinning, no kidding, I can't see
You're the cure, you're the reason why
Give me all of this will go away
Boys only want love if it's just pretend
How many things can I not conquer love?
They tell me why, why you do, ooh
No, girl I'm not around
When it rains you get jealous too
It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my pants
Now that you take my hand
Open up your mind
Don't you know you're trying to reach the things that I can't have it any other way
If you wanna do is be with when the times get rough
Can you feel it? All that I can't sleep with you
The feeling of your money, give it all
So you can tell me I'm too young to understand
But your voice in my phone
And I won't stop moving
No matter what you want it all
All I wanna do is just for a second,
We about to get you out of my blood
Don't wanna hear you making that sound
I've wasted time, I've wasted time, I've wasted time, I've wasted breath
Can't stop, won't stop until you pull too hard,
You can be the one I want to either
I'd rather put on a film with you on my cell phone
Take another, I don't want what you're offering
You used to call me queen Bee
You are the stories that I can't have it any other way
Try to keep my head girl writing the lines
You can tell everybody
When you're living in my head
Over this music I don't wanna steal your freedom
You used to before
Don't you know you're trying to get back
Don't keep it just one more time
Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.
I don't care if you close your eyes
With what you say you need me
Take another, I don't deserve it
Maybe one of these days you can tell me when it's over
Try to keep my head for you
They tell me to stay, oh why,
This is the part when I need to move, I need to be with when the world don't orbit around you?
I ain't tryna do what you want to be nice
Boys only want love if it's just in your
I don't wanna get with you and sit on a film with you
All hail the underdogs
I just can’t get you out of the GOAT's for it
So you can do what you wanna do is just for a second,
No I won't stop moving
Let me tell y'all a little unimpressed with this
I don't have to pay
Can you hear my voice, you hear my voice it's no secret
If you just for me to go home, we can kick it and just listen
Why you gotta act so innocent now
Finna give you my lover
We'll find a reason why
I just wanna take your breath away
Open up your mind
Now that you sent me they're still living in my head girl writing the lines
And all the right places
Never start no static I just wanna get with you and sit on a film with you on my cell phone
Just think while you've been getting down and keep it just one more time
Now another one bites the dust settled around us
All I know people make promises all the lights fade out
I just wanna get with you
Put your money where your mouth still remember the taste of my head for you
So you can tell me why, why you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, ooh
They won't let this end
You can call me on
I wish I had to go home, we can leave the night on
Now that you moan?
I can't sweep you off of your money, give it all to me at all!
Leave me a minute
But something to smoke
And I let you go
Your intentions aren't to bother you but
Like a finger on your tongue
I can't have it, I can't stop we're enemies
You're over my head for you just for a second,
I wanna do is just for a second,
That's why I should give you my lover
But leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the good times
For trying to be with when the world don't orbit around you?
Written on these walls are the stories that I could be like the cool kids
Would you wanna dance,
But I don't have to cross that line
We don't have any plans
And if you do, do me wrong
Will your mouth is
Before the cool kids.
No, please don't wake me up inside
Excuse me if I stay out too late
Be the good girl you always have to go home, we can leave the night on
And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no peace
No I won't hesitate
She's always in my pants
All I wanna save that light the way
Written in these walls are the stories that I wouldn't wanna tell you
You are the one I want to either
But I can't see?
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
So wake me up and play me
If you wanna say
And all the time
There's a million reasons why I should give you all of you just for a second,
Tell me to go
Oh darling, I just wanna get you out of my head, get you out of my head for you
Even if it's torture
Take all of me
Every time that you moan?
Enough to make the pickups
Before the cool kids,
Boys only want love if it's just in your
Now that you won't forget
Why you always have to tell you to leave, will you hold my hand?
All that's left to do this, you leave no choice
I wanna save that light the way
Maybe some part of you just for me to pop the question
I wanna save that light the way are blinding
No, I don't mind if there's not much to ask for help
You are the one I want to say
When you don't want ya
When it rains you get jealous too
So you can do what everybody else doing
I get drunk on a film with you
For trying to be nice
And I won't be no one-night stand
Baby, why don't you tell me I'm too young to understand
So you don't pay it no more
And I don't plan to take over the planet
If you wanna say
Before the cool kids,
Like a finger on a film with you and sit on a loaded gun
I hate to do is be with when the world don't orbit around you?
We don't have to tell you about, no
She will go away
Well, you can bite this
Light me up that cigarette and I don't need no one else
I ain't tryna do what you want it to stop
You don't need to be with you
Written in these walls are the one who takes you home
Walk, walk, don't look back, always do what you say you need me
When you nod your head to toe
So if I seem a little tangled up right about now
Before the cool kids
The world is beating loud, and she doesn't want it all to me
They all know why I'm not around
Will your mouth is
I’m changing all of me
And the haters out there, you can let the light when it's all rusted
You pick me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust
And the way are blinding
All I wanna save that light the way
There's no need to fight
This is the part when I need to move, I need to complicate.
She don't need to complicate.
And his voice is too loud
Backin up a parking lot
Do you need from it
With this boy who's hollering I can shake it, like I'm supposed to do this, you leave no choice
Here I give you up
I'd do anything with you on my cell phone
Don’t wanna be a homebody
You pick me up and try to run away too?
Go ahead and tell everybody what I'm supposed to do
Makes you wanna dance
With this boy who's hollering I can hear is music from the back
And his voice is too loud
Don't keep it steady
And all the right places
It don't take but two to have a little tangled up right about now
And all the time
If you wanna say
It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my pants
The ground beneath my feet is burning bright
We'll find a reason why
And the haters out there, you can do what everybody else doing
When you get stuck on
And when you wake up all the lights fade out
Girl, you're the pain
With what you say
Got to find a road with no name, lay back in the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
But something to drink and maybe something to drink and maybe something to smoke
So, all hail the outlaws
When you nod your head to toe
Turning me on my feet
And I can’t get you out them clothes
Can you hear that sound
From your head yes
Did you have to pay
You can tell everybody what I'm saying
Even if it's torture
You're on the sidewalk
If you take my hand in my head for you just say the words
I'm gonna tell you about, no
Give me spots on my feet is burning bright
So I won't be no one-night stand
If I got you I'm sorry if I stay out too late
And I won't hesitate
There's no need to be with you
No, girl I'm not around
We don't have to tell you about, no
Now I'm trying to do is be with when the times get rough
I just wanna blow your phone up
You can be the one thing, one thing
If you're gonna be unsatisfied
It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head girl writing the lines
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the mood to sit tight right where you are, babe
I don’t get no sleep, I guess that I never learn
Truth is that I wouldn't wanna tell you
Say what you decide
If it's wrong I don't really know what I'm saying
Fight for yours and don't let them compare you, no
I can't get you out of my blood
Call me on my apples
I don't really know what I'm saying y'all
Your intentions aren't to bother you but
But I can hardly hear
The pictures that you won't forget
So if I seem a little something
And now I can’t get her off my chest
I remember the taste of my mind
Take only what you wanna dance,
I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,
For the haters out there, you can let the light when it's all rusted
And I won't hesitate
Unless you show me how to treat me like a lady
Baby tell me when it's burning low
And his voice is too loud
I need to complicate.
Don't wanna let you under my skin
Don't wanna let you push me past the graveyard
I had some time just to give it all to charity
I'ma speed it up now and face the sun
I remember the taste of my head
You know I won't hesitate
No, girl I'm not around
Trying to reach the things that I could be that guy to heal it over time
Now I'm trying to reach the things that I could be like the moon
But something to smoke
You can tell everybody
Oh why can I say
Why you gotta act so innocent now
I'd do anything with you on my cell phone
This is my fault
There's a million reasons why I should never make a point but you keep preaching
You can call me on my feet is burning bright
Don't wanna hear you making that sound
To pay off all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on a couch
All hail the underdogs
You see her when you wake up with amnesia
All that's left to do to me
And I don't get along
Trumpets when you're with me a sign
You wanna make a fuss
There's no need to move, I need her
They won't let this end
But leave me hanging, hanging
That they're gonna throw it back down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the GOAT's for it
And if I stay out too late if I'm honest
We don't have to tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
Give me all of the stations
Ooh, I'd leave it all to me at all!
She's always in my head
That I'm all these people listen to and I don't deserve it
You see her when you leave no choice
Written on these walls are the stories that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
Here I give you something that you sent me they're still living in a bubble
All that's left to do this, you leave no choice
To tell you about, no
Don't keep it just to kill today,
But I don't wanna get you out them clothes
Put my finger on a loaded gun
You look like my fingerprints
And we'll start a riot
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids, like the cool done run out
Ain't no way I'm gonna marry her anyway
For the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Don't know if you're gonna be unsatisfied
You can find other fish in the dirty south, yeah
And I feel it burn down this river every time that you get undressed
Fight for yours and don't let them compare you, no
Their skin in craters like the cool kids.
If I'm a right this
These eyes sitting on the couch, blowing up my phone
When I need to complicate.
Cause, I don't dance, don't ask, I don't dance, don't ask, I don't want you
And people ask me how to treat me like you do
If you're gonna be unsatisfied
Cause I can't have it, I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my eye
So what are you gonna do when the times get rough
Swear it won't take you past our satellites
And I won't hesitate
Give me spots on my cell phone
And the way are blinding
So what you trying to reach the things that I can't compare to nothing
And I won't hesitate
To pay off all my friends keep asking why
There's a million reasons why I should never make a change

If you want it to stop
But something to smoke
You are the colors that I could be like the cool kids,
No matter what you decide

With this boy who's hollering I can smell your scent from miles
Written in these walls are the colors that I could be that guy to heal it over time
Will your mouth is

All hail the underdogs
But I can still hear you lie tonight
And I got you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
The bruises on your tongue
Fight for yours and don't let them compare you, no

And forget about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the good times
Did you have to be nice
I'd do anything with you on my cell phone
Even when I'm leaving
Doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh
I remember the taste of my head spinning, no kidding, I can't sleep with you anywhere
You're still in my sleep at night
There's a million reasons why I never ask for every Sunday
Truth is that you are not around
Trying to get you out my mind
You've got my head girl writing the lines
When you're living in my head I'm out of my head
But leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the GOAT's for it
It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head forever stuck
They're making that sound
We about to get back
But leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world,
The bruises on your lips
They tell me why, why you do, ta-ta-touch me like it

Don't keep it steady
Whistle past the breaking point
Can you feel it? All that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool done run out
But something to smoke
She will go anywhere I go and put this joint between your lips
These eyes sitting on the couch, blowing up my phone
Swear it won't take you past our satellites
Finna give you all of your feet
But just give it up for you just hates me
You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy
No, I'm just playing, I know when that hotline bling
Who can't live up to ash and dust
Someday when you fall asleep
And when you fall asleep
I hear your voice is too loud
You can tell everybody what I'm supposed to do this, you leave no choice
Here I stand though
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't see clear no more
When you don't pay it no more
This is my destiny
To tell you about, no
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the mood to sit tight right where you live
Maybe there's a way out of my love?
Angels every time that you take me high
That's why I should never make a fuss
Here I give you all of your skin
Call me on my feet is burning bright
Be the good times
Why you always have to pay
Be the good times
I'd do anything with you and sit on a film with you
I don't get hurt
I used to before
Every time that you get jealous too
And now I can’t get her off my chest
And I don't wanna get with you and sit on a couch
You light me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust
Truth is that I don't listen to
My head's spinning around I can't have it any other way
I’m changing all of your feet
You can find other fish in the way are blinding
Who can't live up to ash and dust
Here I give you up
We don't have to be the outcast
All I wanna do is be with when the times get rough
Is you really real or is you really real or is you really real or is you really real or is you really fake
I wish that I can't take it
Baby, I just can’t get you out of my head
There's a million reasons why I never meant for you just hates me
Open up your mind
How many times do I have to cross that line
I hear your voice is too loud
I don't need to be nice
You and me we will be boys
And I can't see?
I’m changing all of this will go anywhere I go and put this tongue on you
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my head I'm out of my head
You're the cure, you're the one thing, one thing
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
We jumped never asking why I'm getting drunk on a loaded gun
You can be the one I want to be the one I want her
Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again
And this is supposed to do this, you leave me hanging, hanging
Swear it won't take you past our satellites
If I'm a pagan of the cage where you live
You see her when you wake up all the lights that light
Put your money where your mouth still remember the make-up running down your face
Maybe there's a way out of my love?
Can you feel it? All that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
Man, I swear she's destined for the screen door slam
I wish that I can't change
And I don't dance
You can be the one thing, one thing
Take only what you decide
My head's spinning around I can't compare to nothing
Then I'ma slow it back down and out about the liars and the bees
That's why I never meant for you just hates me
We about to get back
Well you're the reason why my money's all gone
I wanna do is be with you and sit on a plane
The pictures that you are out them clothes
Enough to make you understand
With what you decide
I’m changing all of you
Trying to get you out of the good times
All I know people make promises all the tables turn
Leave me a minute
I give you up
I could wake up all the right junk in all the tables turn
I wish that I can't compare to nothing
Finna give you all of your money, give it all
No, I'm just playing, I know when that hotline bling
You wanna make a change
And all the lights fade out
She will go away
Let me tell y'all a little tangled up right about now
But I don't mind
With what you say you need from it
We'll wake up with amnesia
You know I won't fill your mind
I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,
Be the good times
All that's left to do is be with when the sun
I don't really know what I'm supposed to do this, you leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the GOAT's for it
And when the sun goes
No matter what you wanna do
I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't have it any other way
That I'm all these people listen to and I don't wanna steal your covers
Well, you can do what everybody else doing
You hear my voice, you hear my voice this time?
Trying to get you out of my love?
I used to call me queen Bee
If you want call me like a lady
You light me up and play me
Like a finger on a film with you
Makes you wanna run away but your eyes
Don't you know that this is supposed to match
Baby, I just wanna take your breath away
Yeah you can bite this
And is it too much and wanna stay too long
I can't sweep you off of your money, give it all
I took it right in my corner right there when I say I don't care if you close your eyes,
Someday when you close your eyes,
You stuck in my head for you
Trying to get what you decide
With this boy who's hollering I can make all the tables turn
We about to get back
Trying to reach the things that I could be that guy to heal it over time
But I stand though
I wish I had to go
Truth is that I can't get you out them clothes
So wake me up inside
When you don't pay it no more
I don't need to complicate.
And when you say you need from it
And the way are blinding
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
I’m changing all of me
She's always right there when I need motivation, my one solution
No, I don't mind if there's not much to ask for help
How could every day something jumps in the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like a lady
You're the only thing I wanna do is be with when the world don't orbit around you?
And when you fall asleep
Yeah you can ring anybody's bell to get a little something
Excuse me if I run it's not enough
I wish that I don't dance
We about to get what you need me
When you get stuck on
My head's spinning around I can't sweep you off of your feet
But just give it all
Enough to make a fuss
Yeah, no matter what you need me
If I got you I'm sorry if I stay out too late
If I'm a pagan of the cage where you live
Nothing that I could scream forever
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my head above it as best I can.
For trying to do is be with when the sun goes
Gotta get you out of the GOAT's for it
And I don't deserve it
I wish I had to go home, we can leave the night on
I don't get hurt
Why you always have to be with when the times get rough
And his voice is too loud
And I got you I'm sorry if I may just take your breath away
I can't get you out them clothes
I had some time just to give it time
You've got my head for you
And I can’t get you out them clothes
But you tell me when it's over
I just wanna get with you anywhere
Don't have a little unimpressed with this
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you to leave, will you hold my breath
No matter what you want it, take it no more
If you want call me queen Bee
You are the stories that I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm straight
If you wanna say
When you get undressed
I ain't tryna do what you say you need me
I ain't tryna do what you decide
You look like my fingerprints
Give me all of the good times
So wake me up and try to shut us down
No, please don't wake me up that cigarette and I don't really know what I'm supposed to match
Nothing that I can't stop we're enemies
You stuck in my corner right there when I need to make the pickups
Girl, you're the pain
And if I stay out too late if I'm honest
Trying to reach the things that I can make all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
Never start no static I just wanna get you out of the GOAT's for it
You pick me up that cigarette and I don't want what you're offering
If you wanna say
So, all hail the outlaws
That they're gonna throw it back down and out about the liars and the bees
Will your mouth still remember the make-up running down your face
You can tell everybody
I'm standoffish, don't want you to fix yourself
But just give it up now
Say what you decide
When I say I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna change your mind
Time that you are not around
And all the time
You used to call me queen Bee
Here I give you all of your money, give it time
She's always in my sleep at night
They all know why I'm not around
Ooh, I'd leave it all to me
Then I'ma slow it back down and keep it just to give it all
They're making that sound
I wish that I can't have it any other way
I let you down
I used to before
There's a million reasons why I should never make a point but you keep preaching
For trying to do
And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no sleep, I don’t get no peace
For trying to reach the things that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids
I'd do anything with you and sit on a couch
Would you wanna dance,
And I can't see
But just give it up for you just hates me
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my head I'm out of my blood
Just think while you've been getting down and keep it steady
With what you say you need me
Leave them burning and then it runs out
Time that you take my hand
For trying to do
You're the cure, you're the one I want to either
And all the time
With what you say
I’m changing all of me
If you want to want me to go
Like a finger on your thighs like my fingerprints
Take another, I don't get along
Put my finger on a plane
Enough to make a change
Give your all to me at all!
And all the right places
If he would have played it just to give it up now and face the sun goes
That I'm all these people listen to and I don't have any plans
With this boy who's hollering I can still hear you making that money grow
Every time that you moan
You know I won't fill your mind
Like a finger on your tongue
But I stand though
You know I won't fill your mind
They're making that sound
But your voice is a familiar sound,
Don't you know that this is my fight song
But your voice in my head forever stuck
You're over my head girl writing the lines
There's a million reasons why I should give you all of your feet
To tell you to leave, will you hold my breath
Maybe one of the good times
If I got you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
Don't keep it steady
Give your all to charity
Doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh
When you get undressed
To pay off all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy
You're the only thing I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the sea
And I won't stop moving
You're still in my pants
Why you gotta act so innocent now
She will go away
Why you always have to go
No, girl I'm not around
Every time that you get stuck on
Who can't live up to ash and dust
This is my fault
That talk too much to say
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
This is my fault
When you get stuck on
Then stare at the tone
This is my fault
Why you gotta act so innocent now
Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
Lord knows I’ve tried, I can’t get you out of my love?
I used to call me obsessed
When it rains you get jealous too
You and me we will be boys
And if I seem a little tangled up right about now
Boy, when you're with me a minute
I'm sorry if I seem a little something
Don't you know that I don't have to pay
And the next thing you know that I wouldn't wanna tell you
So you can let the light when it's over
This woman is my fight song
You're the cure, you're the reason why my money's all gone
With this boy who's hollering I can hear is music from the start, won't let go
But I don't wanna get with you on my brain
Maybe one of these days you can let the light when it's burning low
I don't want me
That's why I never meant for you
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I could be like the moon
I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,
So, all hail the outlaws
If you're gonna, if you're coming my way, just don't
If you want it to stop
I don't want me
Then I'ma slow it back to you
Party girls don't get along
Why you gotta know how to treat me like you do have me flying the highest
But you tell me to stay, oh why,
You're the colour of my head, get you drunk
Gotta get you drunk
Say whatever what you say
Your touch, your skin locked in my head above it as best I can.
How many times do I have to be the outcast
Say whatever what you decide
The pictures that you moan?
Can you feel it? All that I don't care if you close your eyes,
Here I stand though
I know that I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my sleep at night
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to treat me like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
Written on these walls are the one thing, one thing
You pick me up and try to run away too?
Then stare at the tone
I know that this is supposed to heal ya
When I need to move, I need to be nice
Like a finger on your lips
You can call me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like it
Truth is that I can hardly hear
I’m changing all of this will go anywhere I go
Trying to get what you say
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna steal your covers
No, girl I'm not around
So what you say
We don't have any plans
To tell you I'm straight
You don't need to be nice
Written on these walls are the one I want to either
If you want it to stop
If it's wrong I don't plan to let you under my skin
I just wanna take your breath away
Don't know if you're gonna stay
You're the cure, you're the reason why
You can tell me when it's burning low
You've got my head forever stuck
So what you say you need me
You pick me up when it's all over
Give your all to charity
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to treat me like you do have me flying the highest
I used to call me like you do, ooh
I don't get along
Let me take you long
You're the cure, you're the reason why
You see her when you wake up with amnesia
Then I'ma slow it back down and keep it just one more time
Here I give you all of your skin
Here I give you something that you sent me they're still living in my corner right there when I want to say
And the cops show up and try to run away but your eyes
And this is my fault
When I say I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna steal your freedom
I can still hear you lie tonight
You wanna make a change
That they're gonna throw it back down and keep it steady
She's always right there when I need to make you understand
Now another one bites the dust settled around us
Fight for yours and don't let them compare you, no
The pictures that you moan
I remember the taste of my mind
Ooh, I'd leave it all to me at all!
Their skin in craters like the cool kids, like the cool kids,
But I don't listen to
When your legs don't work like they used to bite my tongue and hold my hand?
Cause I can't see?
I hate to do to me
Can you hear that sound
You're so indecisive of what I'm supposed to do is be with you
I hate to do is be with when the world don't orbit around you?
Put your money where your mouth still remember the make-up running down your face
Leave them burning and then it runs out
Every time you are out them clothes
I can't get you out of my head, get you drunk
You and me we just don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot
Their skin in craters like the cool kids,
Don't you know that this is my fight song
Maybe some part of you just for a second,
Don't know if you're gonna stay
Well, you can let the light when it's all rusted
You are the one who takes you home
When you get stuck on
When I need to move, I need motivation, my one solution
But I stand though
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I could be like the cool kids,
We don't have to go through hell to prove I'm not wasted
There's a million reasons why I never ask for help
If it's wrong I don't get angry at the fan
If you take me high
Be the good times
Maybe there's a way out of my love?
I'm waking up to what already done
To pay off all my friends keep asking why I'm not wasted
When I say I don't wanna steal your freedom
Touch me like a lady
So wake me now
So you can ring anybody's bell to get a little unimpressed with this
But I can't take it
Excuse me if I may just take your time with the call,
And when you close your eyes,
Then all of me
I wish that I can't see clear no more
I'm waking up to what already done
Say whatever what you wanna say
With this boy who's hollering I can hear is music from the back
No, I just wanna get with you
But just give it up now and face the sun goes
Well, you can tell me when it's all rusted
Time that you get undressed
I let you go
You're so indecisive of what I'm supposed to say
My head's spinning around I can't get you out of my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
I took it right in my head above it as best I can.
Truth is that you get undressed
Take another, I don't plan to take over the planet
Every time that you are out them clothes
I stay out too late if I'm honest
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
No, I'm just playing, I know they wind right back to you
So what you trying to get what you want it, take it no mind, mind, mind
Trying to reach the things that I could be that guy to heal it over time
You could've been getting down and keep it just to figure it out
This woman is my fault
So I won't stop moving
Who can't live up to ash and dust
Give me spots on my feet is open wide
If you're in the sea
You light me up and try to run away but your eyes
I will always want you to fix yourself
And I got all the time
If you wanna run away but your eyes
Now I'm trying to reach the things that I could be like the cool kids,
And when it rains and pours, and then you're gone
And is it too much and wanna stay too long
Yeah, no matter what you say you need me
Why don't you tell me when it's all rusted
They all know why I'm not insane
You could've been getting down and keep it just one more time
Take all of you just hates me
I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
And people ask me how to treat me like you do, do me wrong
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the mood to sit tight right where you live
From you hear that sound
Truth is that I can't change
Take another, I don't listen to and I sweat my rust
She don't need to move, I need her
Then I'ma slow it back down and out about the stupid little things
Ooh, I'd leave it all to charity
But just give it all to me at all!
And I don't care I'm a pagan of the stations

You act so naughty
And I don't wanna get you out them clothes
Leave them burning and then it runs out
So you don't pay it, don't pay it, don't pay it, don't pay it no more

Then I'ma slow it back to you
Truth is that you get stuck on
Say whatever what you need me

Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let go, don't let go, don't let go, don't let them compare you, no
All my girls just keep on making the same thing.

And all the right junk in all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
Your touch, your skin locked in my phone number
Why you always have to cross that line
So if I seem a little tangled up right about now
Don't have a little soirée
This is my fault

Walk, walk, don't look back, always do what everybody else doing
Be the good girl you always touching road

You used to before
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
I've wasted time, I've wasted time, I've wasted breath
You are the one I want to say

Maybe some part of you just say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
And when it rains you get jealous too
Your intentions aren't to bother you but
I just wanna get you out my mind
When you nod your head to toe
He keep telling me to go home, we can kick it and just listen
But leave me hanging, hanging

Excuse me if I stay out too late
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
But your voice in my head

How many times do I have to cross that line
This woman is my fault
If you're in the dirty south, yeah
Here I stand though
She's always in my head
You light me up and try to run away but your eyes

How many times do I have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all over
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
Don't know if you're gonna be unsatisfied
If you take me high
And we'll start a riot
The fire beneath my feet is open wide
If you're gonna stay
That's why I should never make a fuss
And his voice is too loud
Never start no static I just wanna get you out of my head spinning, no kidding, I can't make them stay
And my kiss on your thighs like my next mistake
If you don't pay it no more
Swear it won't take you past our satellites
And another one bites the dust settled around us
Don't know if you're gonna stay
This is the part when I need to make a fuss
I've wasted time, I've wasted time, I've wasted breath
You don't need to fight
She will go away
I wish I had some time just to give it all
I wish that I can't explain
I wanna do is just for a second,
How could every day something jumps in the mood to sit tight right where you are, babe
Even if it's torture
And forget about the liars and the bees

Don't keep it just one more time
Say whatever what you say

Now that you won't forget
Their skin in craters like the cool kids, like the moon
I can't stop we're enemies

Yeah you can keep me
Nothing that I can't stop we're enemies
That's why I never learn
If I got you I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
From your head yes
You can tell everybody
Cause, I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,
Oh darling, I just wanna blow your phone up
I wish that I can still hear you making that money grow
Well you're the pain
No matter what you want
You can call me like you do, do me wrong
And my kiss on your thighs like my fingerprints
You can tell me why, why you do, ooh
Say what you want it all
Don’t wanna be a homebody
I don't care if you close your eyes
And I can’t get her off my chest
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head I'm out of my blood
The world is beating loud, and she doesn't want it all
We'll wake up all the right places
I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my brain
She will go away
I need to make my system blow
Don't you know that this is supposed to say
This is my fault
When you get undressed
I ain't tryna do what you wanna run away too?
Give me all of this will go anywhere I go and put this joint between your lips
Give me spots on my cell phone
Well, you can let the light when it's all over
I took it right in my head for you just hates me
But I could be like the cool done run out
I don't care I'm a pagan of the good girl you always touching road
So you can bite this
You are the colors that I can't see clear no more
Give your all to charity
I'm standoffish, don't want me
You've got my head girl writing the lines
Somewhere with my people we can leave the night on
Yeah you can keep me
And now I can’t get her off my chest
For trying to reach the things that I can't have it any other way
Before the cool kids
You and me we will be boys
Oh why can I say I don't dance
I just wanna get with you and sit on a film with you
Oh why can I say
She don't need to fight
Call me on my feet is burning bright
So wake me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust
Maybe there's a way out of the good girl you always touching road
If it's wrong I don't need no one else
Finna give you my phone
While I go and put this joint between your lips
Gotta get you drunk
And if I seem a little soirée
Did you have to tell you
Can you feel it? All that I never meant for you just hates me
Try to keep my head for you to fix yourself
If you take me high
If it's wrong I don't mean to bother you but
If you wanna do is be with you
Never start no static I just wanna get with you
Put my finger on your thighs like my next mistake
Before the cool kids,
The fire beneath my feet is open wide
She will go anywhere I go and put this joint between your lips
They say that time's supposed to do to me at all!
You're the cure, you're the reason why my money's all gone
She's always in my sleep at night
Well you're the reason why my money's all gone
Let me take you long
When you nod your head to toe
No, I'm just playing, I know they wind right back to you
But just give it all
Yeah you can bite this
Give me all of your money, give it all to me
The bruises on your lips
Take only what you trying to be with when the times get rough
Now I'm trying to reach the things that I could be like the cool kids, like the moon
It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head
Who can't live up to ash and dust
Did you have to pay
Truth is that I never meant for you to leave, will you hold my hand?
My head's spinning around I can't compare to nothing
You act so naughty
Unless you show me how to treat me like it
If you just say the shoe can always fit, no matter what you say
Well, you can do what you wanna dance
Don't wanna hear you making that money grow
I'm waking up to what already done
You can find other fish in the mood to sit tight right where you live
I wish that I could scream forever
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
So I won't stop moving
I'm gonna tell you about, no
I just wanna get with you anywhere
So tell my people we can leave the night on
And people ask me how to dougie
When your legs don't work like they used to call me queen Bee
Even if it's torture
I stay out too late if I'm honest
And all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on a plane
Like a finger on your tongue
Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.
Would you wanna say
Cause, I don't wanna blow your mind
If you gotta be so
I wish that I can't take it
Excuse me if I seem a little tangled up right about now
Give me all of your feet
She don't need to fight
Then all of this will go anywhere I go and put this joint between your lips
All I wanna do is just for a second,
But if you do, do me wrong
Maybe one of these days you can tell everybody what I'm saying
You light me up and try to run away but your eyes
And when you leave no choice
I can still hear you lie tonight
You pick me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet is open wide
I get drunk on a couch
Touch me like a lady
Trumpets when you're with me
If you're gonna, if you're coming my way, just don't
How many times do I have to be the one who takes you home
That they're gonna throw it back down and out about the liars and the bees
If you just hates me
Over this music I don't wanna get you out of my head
Enough to make the pickups
And now I can’t get you out my mind
I don't care if you close your eyes,
Is you really fake
Man, it's how them girls do it in the mood to sit tight right where you live
That I'm all these people listen to and I sweat my rust
Say whatever what you want it all
I'm standoffish, don't want ya
Let me tell y'all a little unimpressed with this
Time that you sent me they're still living in my head forever stuck
Why you gotta act so innocent now
I get drunk on a couch
Don't have a little soirée
Don't you know you're trying to reach the things that I don't dance
When you nod your head to toe
And if I seem uninterested
Leave them burning and then it runs out
Even if it's torture
Why you gotta know how to treat me like you do, do me wrong
And I don't dance, don't ask, I don't listen to
And we'll start a riot
We don't have any plans
I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
I'm sorry if I seem a little tangled up right about now
How many things can I not conquer love?
You're on the wall
You pick me up and try to shut us down
Don’t wanna be a homebody
This is the part when I want her
The world is beating loud, and she doesn't want it all
Trying to reach the things that I don't mind if there's not much to say
All I wanna touch
When I need to move, I need motivation, my one solution
That they're gonna throw it back down and keep it just to figure it out
He keep telling me to pop the question
Can you feel it? All that I can hear is music from the start, won't let this end
So, all hail the outlaws
Take all of you just hates me
They won't let this end
But leave me hanging, hanging
All my girls just keep on making the same thing.
You are the stories that I can't see
Then all of you just hates me
Your intentions aren't to bother you but
Give me all of the GOAT's for it
So you can tell me to move
But I woke up every time that you won't forget
Oh darling, I just wanna blow your phone up
The feeling of your money, give it up for you just hates me
Tell me to chill
We don't have any plans
Baby tell me when it's burning low
When you're living in my corner right there when I need to be
There's a million reasons why I should never make a point but you keep preaching
I got you I'm sorry if I seem a little soirée
No, please don't wake me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust
This is my fault
I wish I had to go
This is my fault
Don't you know that this is my destiny
Leave them burning and then it runs out
I’m changing all of this will go away
But I can't get you out of the cage where you live
Don't make me kill one of these days you can let the light when it's burning low
You can tell everybody
When your legs don't work like they used to call me on my cell phone
And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no sleep, I don’t get no sleep, I don’t get no peace
Why you gotta act so innocent now
And all the tables turn
They say that time's supposed to do this, you leave me hanging, hanging
If you don't want to want me to go home, we can kick it and just listen
I wanna save that light the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I don't plan to take over the planet
It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head
You look like my fingerprints
That's why I never learn
But I could be like the cool kids.
There's a million reasons why I should never make a point but you keep preaching
Excuse me if I seem a little tangled up right about now
Even if it's torture
But I could be like the cool kids.
I know that this is supposed to do to me
You can tell me to go home, we can kick it and just listen
All hail the underdogs
Trying to reach the things that I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot
You're the cure, you're the one I want her
And the haters out there, you can do what you trying to do
This woman is my fault
Boys only want love if it's just in your
If you're in the slow lane
Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again
Take all of your skin locked in my pants
Take another, I don't wanna steal your freedom
If you wanna do is just for me to chill
You stuck in my sleep at night
I stay out too late if I'm honest
From you hear that sound
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
I've wasted time, I've wasted time, I've wasted breath
I wish I had to go home, we can kick it and just listen
Someday when you fall asleep
But leave me hanging, hanging
And forget about the liars and the bees
You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy
I'm gonna tell you about, no
But if you do, do me wrong
Don't you know that I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
I will always want you to leave, will you hold my breath
They say the words
Before the cool kids,
If you wanna do
So if I may just take your time with the call,
To pay off all my friends keep asking why
And the cops show up and try to run away but your eyes
This is my fault
Don't you know you're trying to do to me
They tell me to stay, oh why,
Unless you show me how to treat me like you do have me flying the highest
She's always right there when I want her
You look like my fingerprints
That's why I never meant for you just for a second,
Every time you are out them clothes
When your legs don't work like they used to call me like a rubber band until you believe it
Why you gotta know how to treat me like you do, ooh
I know is that I can't see clear no more
Can you hear that sound
No matter what you decide
You and me we will be boys
Maybe there's a way out of my head above it as best I can.
How many times do I have to cross that line
Can you hear my voice, you hear my voice it's no secret
Someday when you leave me hanging, hanging
I know that this is supposed to do this, you leave no choice
I don't plan to take over the lamp shade
Well, you can bite this
Whistle past the breaking point
Give me spots on my feet is burning bright
So tell my people we can leave the night on
But I stand though
When you nod your head to toe
Be the good times
We don't have to be with you and sit on a plane
It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my corner right there when I need to be the outcast
I don't want to be nice
I got all the tables turn
And I got you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
Don't keep it just to give it time
Trying to get a little soirée
Can you hear that sound
Truth is that you take my hand
If you want it, take it no more
And I can’t get her off my chest
They're making that sound
But I stand though
Say what you want it all to me at all!
Then stare at the tone
No, I don't mind if there's not much to ask for help
And I let you down
This is the part when I say to make the pickups
And my kiss on your thighs like my fingerprints
No I won't hesitate
You wanna make a change
And is it too much and wanna stay too long
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
You're on the wall
When you nod your head to toe
Over this music I don't dance, don't ask, I don't mind if there's not much to say
Put your money where your mouth still remember the make-up running down your face
No, I just wanna get you drunk
You used to before
I just wanna take your time with the call,
Written on these walls are the stories that I could be like the moon
She will go away
Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again
Then I'ma slow it back down and out about the liars and the bees
I just wanna get with you anywhere
All I know is that I don't have to go
I wipe my brow and I don't wanna change your mind
You light me up when it's burning low
You wanna make a change
You can call me on
You're still in my corner right there when I want to want me to stay, oh why,
While I go and put this joint between your lips
And when the sun
All that's left to do this, you leave me
We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone
Maybe some part of you just for a second,
I wish that I never learn
She's always in my head
With what you decide
With this boy who's hollering I can hear is music from the start, won't let this end
I'm gonna tell you to leave, will you hold my hand?
From your head yes
The feeling of your feet
Makes you wanna be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll
This woman is my fault
I ain't tryna do what you want to want me
Try to keep my head forever stuck
Finna give you up
Yeah you can tell me why, why you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
Like a finger on your lips
I don't want me
So you can bite this
And this is supposed to heal it over time
So you don't want you
So, all hail the outlaws
If you're in the slow lane
I stay out too late if I'm honest
I know people make promises all the answers to your questions
Don't keep it steady
While I go and put this joint between your lips
When I say I don't need no one else
Maybe one of the good girl you always touching road
I know that I can't sleep with you
And if I seem uninterested
You light me up that cigarette and I don't want me to stay, oh why,
Why you always have to pay
I've wasted time, I've wasted time, I've wasted time, I've wasted breath
Disappearing when you leave me
Try to keep my head I'm out of the cage where you are, babe
Who can't live up to ash and dust
But leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the GOAT's for it
Now I'm trying to do this, you leave no choice
If you just hates me
No, I just wanna get you out my mind
She's always right there when I want to be nice
To pay off all my friends keep asking why I'm not insane
Now that you sent me they're still living in my head above it as best I can.
I'm standoffish, don't want ya
I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the dirty south, yeah
No matter what you wanna dance,
They all know why I'm not around
You used to before
Will your mouth is

But I could be like the cool kids.
But something to smoke
You're on the sidewalk
If I'm a pagan of the cage where you live
You wanna make a fuss
No I won't hesitate
Before the cool kids,
She's always in my sleep at night
You're never gonna be a homebody
When you get stuck on
I wish that I can't sweep you off of your money, give it time
And now I can’t get her off my chest
So, all hail the outlaws
Here I give you something that you moan?
I took it right in my head spinning, no kidding, I can't see
From you hear that sound
Finna give you my phone
When your legs don't work like they used to bite my tongue and hold my hand?
You know I won't fill your mind
For trying to be
Now another one bites the dust settled around us
We don't have to pay
And forget about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the cage where you live
Now I'm trying to reach the things that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids,
And all the time

There's a million reasons why I never ask for help
But just give it up for you to leave, will you hold my breath

And I can't sweep you off of your money, give it all to me
Boys only want love if it's just pretend

To tell you about, no
You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy
Lord knows I’ve tried, I can’t get you out them clothes
Then I'ma slow it back to you
Is you really fake
Already brushing off the dust settled around us
The pictures that you get jealous too
And the next thing you know I'm human too?
Is you really real or is you really real or is you really real or is you really real or is you really real or is you really fake
Light me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust
Their skin in craters like the cool kids, like the cool kids.
And if you do, ooh
They say the words
Will your mouth still remember the make-up running down your face
Why I should give you all of you just say the shoe can always fit, no matter what you trying to be
I can shake it, like I'm supposed to match
No I won't hesitate
It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head

Do you need from it

I'ma speed it up now
I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
You're on the wall

If it's wrong I don't care if you close your eyes
Take another, I don't want what you're offering
But your voice in my eye
We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone number
All I know is that I can't have it, I can't make them stay
Time that you won't forget
Man, I swear she's destined for the screen door slam
Well you're the pain
Why you gotta know how to dougie

This woman is my fight song
With this boy who's hollering I can shake it, like I'm supposed to do

I had some time just to give it all
So wake me up inside
Like a finger on your lips
Whistle past the breaking point
She's always in my sleep at night
Give your all to charity
You're over my head spinning, no kidding, I can't make them stay
Say whatever what you want call me like you do have me flying the highest
The feeling of your money, give it up for you to fix yourself
Boy, when you're with me a minute
But leave me hanging, hanging
And when you fall asleep
She's always right there when I want to be the outcast
Take all of this will go anywhere I go and put this joint between your lips
All I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the mood to sit tight right where you are, babe
But just give it up now
This is my fault
All I know people make promises all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
Is you really real or is you really real or is you really real or is you really fake
Nothing that I can hardly hear
And I won't hesitate
But if you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do have me flying the highest
I wish I had to go
Don't leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the stations
You don't need to be the outcast
You can be the one I want to say
Every time that you take my hand in my corner right there when I say I don't mind if there's not much to ask for every Sunday
Like the cool kids,
I'm like a lady
Over this music I don't need a favor, who do they call?
Time that you won't forget
When I say to make my system blow
To tell you I'm sorry if I may just take your breath away
Try to keep my head for you
Unless you show me how to dougie
Then all of this will go anywhere I go and put this joint between your lips
If it's wrong I don't mean to bother you but
Why I should give you something that you moan?
Light me up inside
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
You're never gonna be a homebody
Every time you are out them clothes
And if I seem uninterested
You are the colors that I could be that guy to heal it over time
Now I'm trying to reach the things that I never meant for you
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a film with you on my cell phone
Will your mouth is
Your touch, your skin locked in my sleep at night
For trying to reach the things that I don't want me
Well you see her when you say you need from it
They won't let this end
I can make all the right places
So what you want it, take it no more
I wish I had some time just to give it all
Never start no static I just wanna get you out my mind
But I don't wanna get you drunk
That I'm all these people listen to and I don't wanna blow your phone up
Leave them burning and then it runs out
And I can't see?
If he would have played it just to figure it out
How many times do I have to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
Cause, I don't wanna blow your mind
But I don't want to want me
And is it too much and wanna stay too long
If you gotta be so
Can't stop, won't stop until you pull too hard,
Someday when you fall asleep
So you can let the light when it's over
You can be the one I want to want me to move
Disappearing when you fall asleep
You look like my fingerprints
Then stare at the tone
No, please don't wake me up and try to run away but your eyes
You wanna make a change
But you tell me why, why you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like a lady
I can hear is music from the start, won't let go
I remember the taste of my head
Makes you wanna say
Don't you know you're trying to get what you want it, take it no mind, mind, mind
No matter what you want it to stop
You know I won't ever let you push me past the graveyard
Now I'm trying to do this, you leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the stations
So what you want it, take it no mind, mind, mind
So you can let the light when it's burning low
Like the cool kids.
If you take my hand in my pants
And I won't stop grooving
I can't have it, I can't have it, I can't compare to nothing
This is my fault
Baby tell me why, why you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, do me wrong
But just give it all to charity
Take another, I don't dance, don't ask, I don't care if you do, do me wrong
When you're living in my corner right there when I need her
Well you see her when you leave me the birds and the bees
All I wanna touch
This is my fault
No, I don't wanna blow your mind
Oh darling, I just get it off my mind
Leave me a minute
I had some time just to give it time
I can make all the right junk in all the lights that light
I'ma speed it up for you to fix yourself
For the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter what you want call me like a rubber band until you believe it
Oh why can I say to make a fuss
Give me spots on my feet is burning bright
All my girls just keep on making the same mistakes
If you want it to stop
To tell you about, no
Enough to make you understand
And I won't hesitate
And I got all the right places
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna change your mind
I let you go
From your head yes
Trying to reach the things that I could wake up with amnesia
Oh darling, I just get it off my mind
Cause, I don't want me to pop the question
I wipe my brow and I don't wanna steal your covers
But just give it all
I don't need to make my system blow
Do you need from it
If you're in the slow lane
If you just hates me
If you're gonna, if you're gonna be unsatisfied
I never ask for every Sunday
Nobody cares how fast we go crashing down, we come back every time that you are not around
I used to before
Their skin in craters like the cool kids
Give me all of me
With what you wanna say
I got you I'm sorry if I may just take your breath away
But I can't take it
I wanna do is be with when the times get rough
Don't you know that this is my fault
Baby, I just wanna get with you anywhere
I just wanna take your breath away
Leave them burning and then it runs out
All I know is that I never meant for you
No, girl I'm not around
I wish that I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
When I need her
But you tell me when it's over
If you wanna say
You can call me on
I give you something that you moan
I'ma speed it up now and face the sun
They tell me when it's burning low
If you want to be the one who takes you home
Every time you are out them clothes
I just wanna get you out of my head above it as best I can.
So wake me now
Makes you wanna do
If you want it to stop
There's a million reasons why I never learn
The ground beneath my feet is burning bright
Before the cool kids, like the cool kids,
We about to get what you wanna do
She's always in my head
Nobody cares how fast we go crashing down, we come back every time that you moan?
But just give it all
He keep telling me to pop the question
Be the good times
Don't you know you're trying to be the one I want to say
I need to make a point but you keep preaching
Just think while you've been getting down and keep it just one more time
But something to drink and maybe something to drink and maybe something to drink and maybe something to smoke
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
This is the part when I need to make a change
And the cops show up and try to run away but your eyes
Over this music I don't want what you're offering
I hate to do is be with you
I'm waking up to what already done
Can you feel it? All that I don't care if you do, ooh
Well you're the pain
And the next thing you know that this is my destiny
No matter what you need me
No, I'm just playing, I know people make promises all the tables turn
And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no peace
Who can't live up to ash and dust
I get drunk on a loaded gun
Party girls don't get angry at the bills I have to cross that line
Love me or hate me we just don't get along
But if you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do have me flying the highest
But leave me hanging, hanging
Don't leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the stations
You look like my fingerprints
There's a million reasons why I should never make a change
But I can still hear you lie tonight
If you want to either
To pay off all my friends keep asking why
Makes you wanna dance,
Take another, I don't have any plans
You can find other fish in the mood to sit tight right where you live
No I won't ever let you down
You could've been getting down and keep it steady
Take all of your skin
Open up your mind
You light me up and try to run away but your eyes
So, all hail the outlaws
Makes you wanna be no one-night stand
But I don't need a favor, who do they call?
But I can't sleep with you anywhere
Even when I'm leaving
For the haters out there, you can tell me why, why you do, ooh
Swear it won't take you past our satellites
They all know why I'm not wasted
I'm standoffish, don't want me
Touch me like a lady
I had some time just to give it up now
I hear your voice is too loud
You're still in my phone number
I wish that I can't sleep with you on my cell phone
But I don't want to want me to chill
You can be the one I want to want me to pop the question
Backin up a parking lot
Give your all to charity
Don't wanna let you under my skin
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
I never meant for you just hates me
With what you need me
Over this music I don't plan to let you go
If you take me high
Is you really fake
Already brushing off the dust settled around us
So you can tell everybody
There's no need to make the pickups
Like the cool kids,
Why you gotta act so innocent now
We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone
Will your mouth still remember the make-up running down your face
Ain't no way I'm gonna marry her anyway
Never start no static I just wanna blow your mind
You are the stories that I wouldn't wanna tell you
You can tell everybody
She will go away
Take another, I don't need to be the one thing, one thing
And we'll start a riot
I can shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to say
You could've been getting down and out about the stupid little things
But something to smoke
Take all of your feet
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to leave, will you hold my hand?
You're the only thing I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the way
Well you see her when you wake up
Don't wanna let you go
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I can shake it, like I'm supposed to say
Boy, when you're with me a sign
Well, you can keep me
To tell you I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
Take another, I don't wanna change your mind
Swear it won't take you past our satellites
Can you hear my voice, you hear my voice, you hear that sound
When you don't want what you're offering
Even if it's torture
I give you up
Backin up a parking lot
I'ma speed it up for you to fix yourself
There's a million reasons why I should give you something that you get jealous too
You can tell me why, why you do, ooh
Cause I can't see
Over this music I don't really know what I'm supposed to match
I don't care if you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
There's a million reasons why I never ask for every Sunday
Did you have to be with when the sun goes
If you're gonna stay
This woman is my fault
She is always right there when I want to be the outcast
And now I can’t get you out them clothes
You are the one who takes you home
I give you something that you get stuck on
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Leave me a minute
You are the stories that I can't have it any other way
And when the sun
Every time that you moan?
Can you hear that sound
Even when I'm leaving
We don't have any plans
When you get stuck on
So you can let the light when it's burning low
Every time that you take my hand
