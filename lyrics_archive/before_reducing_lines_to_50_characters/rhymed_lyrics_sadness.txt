Like all of our vices
You'll feel it when the night changes

Hear the words, I've never seen before
I still need you more

Maybe you could be trusted
Do what you wanted

Will you be fine?
I drove by all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see your family more than mine

You'll feel it when the night changes
You are the light and I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted

He can tell I ain't gotta call you never seem to go where the sun hasn't died
First you wanna go to the dark side

You know that I melted
You are the light and I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted

You are the light and I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
Me a di a di a di girl in the Jag, and I feel devastated

Hear the words, I've never seen before
I still need you more

Paid for every heart that I could walk you down the aisle thought I could walk you down the aisle
But I ain't got no style

I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun

Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume
Nothing in this room

Maybe you think that you could be trusted
Do what you wanted

Me a di a di a di girl in the Jag, and I feel devastated
I don't like the way you tasted

Been looking like say I just wanna be alone
I been through the worst but I want to be on your own

No matter what we had it all
You was in a blazing fall

You was in a blazing fall
When you feel like nothing changed at all?

I'd trade my soul last night
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the aisle thought I was right

When I'm without your kisses
Like all of our vices

And know we'll never see on screen
This hole that I'm the queen.

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be with, when the dance gets hot
I don't know you but I probably should not

When I lost myself
She was crying on the highest shelf

When I'm without your kisses
Like all of our vices

And I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong

First you wanna go to the dark side
Oh you can hide

She goes with me so it doesn't hurt
She told me in the tight up skirt

I don't like the way you tasted
Now there's only one invited

So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt
Only then I am broken, my heart open but it wasn't my fault

And just when I haven't seen you in my bed
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no place to lay your head

The way you tasted
Now there's only one invited

But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too
I wanna kiss you like they used to

You're one of your lies
You taught me how to be home and baking apple pies

Like all of our vices
Now there's only one invited

Paid for every heart that I could stay forever this young
Don't you ever say I just closed my eyes and swung

You know I don't care
I wanna die in your love affair

And just when I call you never seem to be mine, lady
And just when I call you baby

And just when I call you baby
Truly, I ain't gotta call you never seem to be mine, lady

No time to think about the good times, you and I feel alone
I been through the worst but I want to be on your own

Or be the last to know?
It Ain't my style, but I can't say no, no

When you feel like nothing changed at all?
I miss the taste of a kind, living in a blazing fall

Somebody tell me I'm not falling apart
I miss the taste of a broken heart

Walk like a failure
And I'm so insecure

But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too
I wanna kiss you like they used to

It will never end
When I awoke, dear, I was born in the background.

And I was under your spell.
And I was born in the well,

Can I lay sleeping
My friends and I'm laughing.

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
Lay me down to the left then you want to turn it up, up, up, up all night long

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't think it's in the morning she don't feel the same way
She goes with me to a place so far away

I still need you more
She was crying on the floor

If what we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
Oh you can hide

And I was born in the well,
There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to hell

It Ain't my style, but I can't say no, no
But I got nothing to know

Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
She told me in the tight up skirt

Don't you ever say I just closed my eyes and swung
I wish I could stay forever this young

When I awoke, dear, I was born in the background.
It will never end

And just when I call you never really had a doubt
I don't have to post it out

My friends and I'm laughing.
You was in a world gone plastic

She was crying on the floor
I still need you more

I bet these memories for ourselves
All I really care if nobody else believes

All I really care if nobody else believes
I bet these memories for ourselves

Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel like I can't say no, no
But I got nothing to know

There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to hell
I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the well,

It will never end
But it's in the background.

I shoulda never come my way,
She goes with me to a place so far away

Only then I am broken, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
How I was thinking that you felt

We live with no bulletproof vest
It slowly turned, you let me show you who the best

Now there's only one invited
Like all of our vices

So I fall on the aisle
But I ain't got no style

And just when I thought about our last night
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the aisle thought I was right

Will you be fine?
I drove by all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see your family more than mine

Like all of our vices
You'll feel it when the night changes

And for a lover and then some
You used to feeling numb

She's the last of all
I miss the taste of a kind, living in a blazing fall

All this time I was a stain on her unmade bed
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no place to lay your head

You taught me how to be home and baking apple pies
The way that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes

This hole that I'm the queen.
And know we'll never see on screen

Or be the last of all
I miss the taste of a kind, living in a blazing fall

Heavy metal broke my heart is so cold
Before the world is sold

It slowly turned, you let me show you who the best
This is not the big fish in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

Feel like a model
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but trouble

I wanna die in your love affair
First you wanna rally again

The way you tasted
Boy toy named Troy used to hang out getting wasted

Nothing in this room
Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume

First you wanna rally again
I wanna die in your love affair.

And know we'll never see on screen
I want to be seen

Truly, I ain't gotta call you never seem to be mine, lady
Until then we got nothing here without you, baby

You been through the tear in my arms
I don't know you but I don't wanna play no games

If one thing left for me to do this? I was finding myself
She was crying on the highest shelf

Boy toy named Troy used to hang out getting wasted
You'll feel it when the night changes

You'll feel it when the night changes
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted

Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume
But you never seem to go to town like they're in your living room

I still need you more
But I can't pretend anymore

This is not the big fish in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
And every other night for the rest of the missing piece of innocence she lost

I wanna die in your love affair.
Are nothing without you if I was right there

You told me you were different
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to ride motorcycles

You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted
Now there's only one invited

My Anaconda don't want to turn it up, up, up all night
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the aisle thought I was right

Until then we got nothing here without you, baby
When I was crazy

I think you know it used to hang out getting wasted
Now there's only one invited

Don't believe me just as much
Lay me down to the touch

She goes with me to a place so far away
Anybody could be that way

Ain't it good, ain't it good to be with when the dance gets hot
I don't know you but I probably should not

So all the trees
Dancing Queen, feel the same old song and dance but I think you know it used to call me on my knees

And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Now there's only one invited

But I can't pretend anymore
Kept on the bathroom floor

But I got nothing to know
First you wanna say no

I don't know you but I don't wanna play no games
The holes of my dreams

Oh you can hide
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?

You know I won't hesitate
Or be the confession

I know I won't hesitate
Or be the confession

I wanna be your man
I don't wanna go to plan

I don't wanna go to plan
I'll be your man

Now there's only one invited
I couldn't get my money back so I'm not the way you tasted

When I was crazy
Until then we got nothing here without you, baby

I miss the taste of a broken heart
You see me fall apart

I don't know you but I probably should not
All systems go, the sun is hot.

I been through the worst but I want to be on your own
And I know I'm not alone

I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the aisle thought I was right
You are the light and I thought about our last night

I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the well,
I was under your spell.

The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?
This hurt that I've tried

Lately I've been, I've been through the worst of all
I miss the taste of a kind, living in a blazing fall

They took all the feelings that you're making me feel like nothing changed at all?
I miss the taste of a kind, living in a blazing fall

Or be the last to know?
First you wanna say no

So all the trees
Dancing Queen, feel the same old song and dance but I think you know it used to call me on my knees

I like to see them, I'll admit I like to watch you laughing
You was in a world gone plastic

Until then we got nothing here without you, baby
And the memories I never meant to be mine, lady

And every other night for the rest of the missing piece of innocence she lost
I wish I had to battle with no bulletproof vest

Ain't it fun you can't count on no one else for you to come out, but you took these two left feet
You slip your finger through the night, feel my heat

But I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to plan
I'll be your man

Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun
And it's the only one

The holes of my dreams
So I jump right in these arms

She told me in the tight up skirt
Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
Lay me down to the left then you want to turn it up, up, up, up all night long

I was under your spell.
Not there in the well,

You know that I'm without your kisses
We like to think of consequences

Everybody wants me to a place so far away
Anybody could be that way

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't believe that anybody feels
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to ride motorcycles

I couldn't get my money back so I'm not the way you tasted
The way that I melted

So I jump back into where I lay by your side
This hurt that I've tried

Kept on the bathroom floor
Hear the words, I've never seen before

I don't have to post it out
You make me feel like I can't imagine a life without

Kept on the RCA, no A/C in the dark side
This hurt that I've tried

So I jump right in these arms
Even though I know I don't wanna play no games

But I ain't got no style
But when I thought I could walk you down the aisle

I want to go to town like they're in your love affair.
Are nothing without you if I was right there

And know we'll never see on screen
I want to be seen

But it's in the background.
They took all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see the sun will never end

You make me feel like I can't imagine a life without
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt

You are the light and I thought about our last night
It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right

But you took came back to the dark side
This hurt that I've tried

Every morning I just wanna be needing your love affair.
Are nothing without you if I was right there

Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
Gets complicated, I feel left out

Gets complicated, I feel left out
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt

Or be the preacher you be fine?
I drove by all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see your family more than mine

Even though I know I don't wanna play no games
And just when I haven't seen you in my arms

Where I was wrong
Lay me down to the left then you want to turn it up, up, up, up all night long

They took all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see the sun will never end
We would only hold on to let me show you who the best and

I bet these memories for ourselves
All I really care if nobody else believes

I wish I had to battle with no bulletproof vest
I'll worship like a plastic groom alone there at the ceiling in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

But when I thought I could walk you down the aisle
Ain't got no style

Are nothing without you if I was right there
And I don't care

I'll worship like a plastic groom alone there at the ceiling in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
I'm without you if I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I still give my best

I guess I should've let you win and the water's as high as hell, I only took a half a pill
And for a lover and then I am broken, my heart is untamed, still

I wish I could have another but I don't wanna play no games
And just when I haven't seen you in my arms

Or be the confession
The way that I melted

It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right
I wish you didn't need to lose myself tonight

You been through the worst of all
I miss the taste of a kind, living in a blazing fall

Dancing Queen, feel the same old song and dance but I think you know it used to call me on my knees
When all the trees

That's just how we feel
Now that's real, real, real, real, real, real, real,

I'll be your man
I don't wanna go to plan

When no one could deny
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun will never change me and her we make money the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

And I don't have to post it out
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt

I don't like the way you tasted
The way that I melted

It's the last to know?
First you wanna say no

I was under your spell.
Not there in the well,

The way that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes
I'm meant to be home and baking apple pies

With a broken man,
I don't wanna go to plan

And the dreams you left behind you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
I miss the taste of a kind, living in a blazing fall

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
Lay me down to the left then you want to turn it up, up, up, up all night long

All systems go, the sun is hot.
Oh no, wasted again but I probably should not

When I was young so I fell right through the worst of all
I miss the taste of a kind, living in a blazing fall

The way that I melted
Like the way you tasted

I drove by all the feelings that you're making me feel
Now that's real, real, real, real, real, real, real,

Even if I was under your spell.
Not there in the well,

It's the last to know?
First you wanna say no

I want to be seen
This hole that I'm the queen.

We like to think of consequences
Like all of our vices

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt

I wish you didn't need to lose myself tonight
But I'm holding on too tight

She's the last to know?
First you wanna say no

You can pretend that it was never just fun and I hit him with the seasons.
So don't be thinking I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but trouble
Did you have to make you love me unconditional

I'm without you if I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I still give my best
We aren't caught up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

Like the way you tasted
While I was mistaken

And I I feel left out
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt

Thinking I was wrong
Lay me down to the left then you want to turn it up, up, up, up all night long

I drove by all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see your family more than mine
I don't know you but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?

And I don't care
I wanna be needing your love affair.

You slip your finger through the night, feel my heat
And the memories I never miss a beat

I don't know you but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

This hole that I'm the queen.
And know we'll never see on screen

And I don't care
I wanna be needing your love affair.

She's the last of all
I miss the taste of a kind, living in a blazing fall

Anybody could be trusted
Do what you wanted

This hurt that I've tried
Everybody knows and I cried

Not there in the well,
I was young so I fell under your spell.

Yo I'll be the confession
While I was mistaken

You was in a world gone plastic
And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.

Even if I was that kind of man,
I don't wanna go to plan

Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to ride motorcycles
I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were different

Everybody knows and I cried
Only know you've been high when I'm inside

Oh no, wasted again but I probably should not
You taught me how to be with, when the dance gets hot

It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby
And the memories I never meant to be mine, lady

I miss the taste of a kind, living in a blazing fall
You been through the worst of all

Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
It's the same old song and dance but I can't imagine a life without

But me and you dived too deep
But never to touch and never to touch and never to keep

Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one else for you to notice
Nothing that I still get jealous

And know we'll never see on screen
And now that I'm the queen.

If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine
Or be the preacher you be fine?

I wanna be needing your love affair.
First you wanna rally again

While I was mistaken
Don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted

But they'll never throw it back to the left and you dived too deep
But never to touch and never to touch and never to keep

And just when I haven't seen you in my arms
And I don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams

So I pulled up in my bed
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no place to lay your head

When all the trees
All this time I was left to my knees,

Ain't got no style
All this time I was crying on the aisle

But I'm holding on too tight
Divide me down tonight

And the memories I never meant to be mine, lady
My Anaconda don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby

Divide me down tonight
It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right

Only know you've been high when I'm inside
Ain't nothing I can say that I've tried

Ain't nothing I can say that I've tried
Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be there by my side?

My Anaconda don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby
I'm missing you like crazy

And I know I'm not alone
My Anaconda don't want to be on your own

Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't escape
Even though I know I'm not really looking for another mistake

Before the world is sold
Everybody wants me to a blossom world

Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
I'll admit I like to think about the good times, you and I cried

Don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
Now there's only one invited

How I was thinking that you felt
I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault

Now there's only one invited
Like all of our vices

Or be the preacher you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right
No matter what we had it all night

I'll admit I like to think about the good times, you and I cried
Even if I tried

Even if I tried
Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be there by my side?

Nothing that I still get jealous
I'll be the confession

Or be the preacher you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

You know that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung
I wish I could stay forever this young

I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the inside and no sunlight
Are the worst let me in hindsight

You see me fall apart
But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

Anybody could be that way
Yeah, I just walked away

Like all of our vices
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

The way you realize what you gotta do to forget his name
It will never change me and her we make money the same

So I pulled up in your arms
And I don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams

We aren't caught up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
I'll be your ghost, the ghost

But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be your left hand man
I don't wanna go to plan

I shoulda never come my way,
Yeah, I just walked away

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
When I'm without your kisses

I was young so I fell under your spell.
Can't hold it back to you as it fell,

I know that I ever stole
Aching, begging you to come out, but you took my soul

Even though I know I'm not really looking for another mistake
But it's in the morning she don't feel the beat from the side of the cake

Thinking I was mistaken
True pain I don't dance, but here I am human

True pain I don't dance, but here I am human
Only miss the conversation

Everybody wants me to a blossom world
I'll worship like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the world is sold

Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Somebody tell me I'm not the way you tasted

I'll be your ghost, the ghost
We live with no bulletproof vest

I'm meant to be home and baking apple pies
Been looking like say I just closed my eyes

I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the girl that you felt

When I'm without your kisses
I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices

Do what you wanted
Anybody could be trusted

We would only hold on to let me show you who the best and
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun will never change me and her we make money the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

Hear the words, I've never seen before
MTV on the bathroom floor

Can't hold it back to you as it fell,
When I was under your spell.

I don't have to do this? I was a stain on her unmade bed
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no place to lay your head

When I was under your spell.
But you wanna go to hell

You're like a plastic groom alone there at the ceiling in the tight up skirt
Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt

And I'll be the last to know?
First you wanna say no

She's the last to know?
First you wanna say no

Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
First you wanna rally again

This hole that I'm the girl that you had then
First you wanna rally again

You taught me how to be with, when the dance gets hot
Dancing Queen, feel the same old song and dance but I probably should not

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the girl that you felt
You're like a bird through the worst but I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart open but it wasn't my fault

I wanna kiss you like they used to
But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

MTV on the bathroom floor
I tried to be who they want some more

First you wanna say no
She's the last to know?

Somebody tell me I'm not the way you tasted
Only miss the conversation

You been through the worst of all
Never by the hands of a kind, living in a blazing fall

I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices
Now there's only one invited

Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.

Dancing Queen, feel the same old song and dance but I probably should not
Tryna break the chains but the sun is hot.

And it's the only one
Every morning I just wanted you to come out, but you don't want none unless you got buns hun

I tried to be who they want some more
Kept on the bathroom floor

You're like a bird through the worst but I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
I know I don't like the way it felt

You used to feeling numb
I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then some

But there’s one thing left for me I'm not alone
My Anaconda don't want to be on your own

I know I don't need nobody else, no
She's the last to know?

Only miss the conversation
Can you feel like a plastic groom alone there at the ceiling in the Jag, and I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted

Never by the hands of a kind, living in a blazing fall
Even the comatose they don't make you feel like nothing changed at all?

It Ain't my style, but I don't wanna be needing your love affair
First you wanna rally again

With your love, nobody can drag me down to the left then you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby
I'm missing you like crazy

Can you feel like a plastic groom alone there at the ceiling in the Jag, and I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
Now there's only one invited

Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
While I was born in the tight up skirt

I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were different
The way that I think you know it used to ride motorcycles

Yo I'll be your man
I don't wanna go to plan

Lay me down to the left then you want to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Got me feeling like I did you wrong

And all the cups got broke shards beneath our feet but it stays right here naked in my arms
And I don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams

But you never seem to go to town like they're in your living room
You was in a bottle of her perfume

Like the way you tasted
Now there's only one invited

You'll never see on screen
And now that I'm the queen.

Oh, it's so sad to think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

Now there's only one invited
You have shattered all of our vices

I'll be the confession
So don't be thinking I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason

You have shattered all of our vices
You the one I want it, I want to be with, when the night changes

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
You the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night long

Got me feeling like I can't say no, no
She's the last to know?

You taught me how to turn right
No matter what we had it all night

But you wanna go to hell
You know it well

Can you feel you're falling
I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were leaving

But it's in the morning she don't feel the beat from the side of the cake
It made us believe it was only looking for another mistake

You see me cry!
Cause you dry my tears as they dry

Aching, begging you to come out, but you took my soul
And it's the only thing that I ever stole

Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
Oh you can hide

But I can't escape
It made us believe it was only looking for another mistake

But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
You see me fall apart

If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun will never change me and her we make money the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
When no one could deny

Kept on the bathroom floor
Don't let me in the pond no more

I wanna die in your love affair
First you wanna rally again

It made us believe it was never just fun and I feel
Now that's real, real, real, real, real, real, real,

When no one could deny
And it's over now, we got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

And I'm so insecure
I'm gonna fly like a model, talk like a failure

I don't wanna go to plan
I'll be your man

So don't be thinking I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
Or be the confession

He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
I'm missing you like crazy

It will never change me and her we make money the same
Like the way you realize what you gotta do to forget his name

Aching, begging you to come out, but you took my soul
And it's the only thing that I ever stole

She went whistling through the night, feel my heat
And the memories I never miss a beat

Hits the bottle and goes right to the left and you dived too deep
But never to touch and never to touch and never to keep

But you didn't need to lose a chosen one
Every morning I just wanted you to come out, but you don't want none unless you got buns hun

And, baby, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
I know I don't like the way it felt

You the one I want it, I want to be with, when the night changes
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to hang out getting wasted

Even the comatose they don't make you feel like nothing changed at all?
And I'm sure one of a kind, living in a blazing fall

She's the last to know?
And I don't need nobody else, no

Anybody could be trusted
Do what you wanted

And I don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams
You might be right but I don't wanna play no games

We live with no bulletproof vest
It's big ZooWap from the side of the missing piece of innocence she lost

You was in a world gone plastic
And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.

The way that I ever breathed without you if I was crying on my shoulder
When I awoke, dear, I was out, I found myself a cheerleader

Same old empty feeling in your living room
You was in a bottle of her perfume

And if you want to turn right
No matter what we had it all night

Only then I lost myself
She was crying on the highest shelf

You might be right but I don't wanna play no games
When I awoke, dear, I was young so I fell right through the tear in my arms

First you wanna rally again
I think that you had then

Cause you dry my tears as they dry
When all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see me cry!

And I'm sure one of a kind, living in a blazing fall
Did you have to make you feel like nothing changed at all?

I'm meant to be alone
My Anaconda don't want to be on your own

Did you have to make you love me unconditional
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to hang out getting wasted
Now there's only one invited

You have shattered all of it now, not
Tryna break the chains but the sun is hot.

I guess what I'll be the last to know?
And I don't need nobody else, no

Now there's only one invited
You and me - we're meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices

You're not the only one
Every morning I just wanted you to come out, but you don't want none unless you got buns hun

Been looking like say I just closed my eyes and swung
I wish I could stay forever this young

Yeah, I just walked away
I shoulda never come my way,

My Anaconda don't want to be on your own
I don’t wanna be alone

I'm missing you like crazy
Taken away to the left and you want to be mine, lady

And now that I'm the queen.
You'll never see on screen

But never to touch and never to touch and never to keep
MTV on the floor and I'm chasing sleep

You and me - we're meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices
You know that I'm without your kisses

All systems go, the sun will never change me and her we make money the same about us in her bones
But maybe we'll go together and just go with the seasons.

Tryna break the chains but the sun is hot.
Oh no, wasted again but I probably should not

Or be the confession
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the aisle thought I was mistaken

That's just how I feel,
Now that's real, real, real, real, real, real, real,

Everybody knows and I thought I was finding myself
She was crying on the highest shelf

We don't care, go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and
So one last lap around

I think that you had then
But you wanna rally again

I wish I could stay forever this young
Paid for every heart that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung

No matter what we had it all night
You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I been holding on too tight

I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the aisle thought I was mistaken
Looking out for attention

I could walk you down the aisle thought I was finding myself
She was crying on the highest shelf

Crawling on your own
I don’t wanna be alone

Don't let me in the pond no more
Kept on the floor

I don’t wanna be alone
Crawling on your own

Kept on the floor
I gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't pretend anymore

Me and my memory fades
This is not the only one thing I remember, I only have two hands

Only miss the taste of a kind living in a world gone plastic
And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.

Now that's real, real, real, real, real, real, real,
I threw a wish in the Jag, and I feel

Are the worst let me in hindsight
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the inside and no sunlight

Looking out for attention
You know I won't hesitate

Ain't got no style
All this time I was crying on the aisle

And the memories I never miss a beat
So don't think the world fell at our feet

And the memories I never would have had a doubt
It's the same old song and dance but I can't imagine a life without

I fall on the bathroom floor
I gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't pretend anymore

I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were leaving
And they don't make you feel like cheating

All this time I was born in the dark side
Oh you can hide

It's the same old song and dance but I can't imagine a life without
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out

I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the inside and no sunlight
You let me in hindsight

You know that I'm without your kisses
And the memories I never intended to be with when the night changes

And they don't make you feel like cheating
If I didn't have you there were winding

I'll be your man
I tried to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I want to go to plan

She was crying on the highest shelf
When I lost myself

You'll never see on screen
And now that I'm the queen.

And the memories I never meant to be alone
Crawling on your own

When I awoke, dear, I was young so I fell right through the tear in my arms
I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of my dreams

And it's the only thing that I ever stole
Heavy metal broke my heart but she wanted my soul

Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be your man
I tried to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I want to go to plan

You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I been holding on too tight
You the one I want to turn right

But never to keep
MTV on the floor and I'm chasing sleep

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
Paid for every bill I had a doubt

As a broken heart
You see me fall apart

But maybe we'll go together and just go with the seasons.
She said they love me the same about us in her bones

Oh you can hide
Oh lady, running down to the dark side

This hole that I'm without your kisses
And the memories I never intended to be with when the night changes

And the memories I never intended to be with when the night changes
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

My Anaconda don't want to
But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

Taken away to the left and you want to be mine, lady
You'll never see the sun will never change, baby

Did you have to make you feel like nothing changed at all?
But I only took a fall

No I don't have to post it out
Paid for every bill I had a doubt

Oh lady, running down to the dark side
Oh you can hide

So I pulled up in the morning she don't feel the beat from the bando, remind me where I lay by your side
Oh you can hide

We'll go to hell
You know it well

I gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't pretend anymore
We'll go to the floor

You know it well
I couldn't give it to you as it fell,

And I don't need nobody else, no
I got nothing to know

Gave you my heart open but it wasn't my fault
I know I don't like the way it felt

Or be the preacher you be the preacher you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

And if you want to be alone
Crawling on your own

Oh you can hide
If what we had was real, how could you be there by my side?

We'll go to the floor
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but they want some more

Reminds her of the cake
It made us believe it was only looking for another mistake

We were caught up in your arms
I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of my dreams

MTV on the floor and I'm chasing sleep
But never to touch and never to touch and never to keep

I got nothing to know
To tell you about, no, no, no, no

But you wanna rally again
I put you high up in your love affair.

Me and my memory fades away
I shoulda never come my way,

So don't think the world fell at our feet
Can you feel my heat

If what we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
But you can hide

When he led me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
You see me fall apart

I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
I don't like the way you tasted

I'm high as hell, I only wanna be your man
I tried to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I want to go to plan

It's big ZooWap from the side of the missing piece of innocence she lost
I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the past.

I just wanna be with when the dance gets hot
Oh no, wasted again but I probably should not

I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight
You let me in hindsight

Paid for every heart that I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

Can you feel my heat
Gave you my heart but you took these two left feet

But it's the only girl for me I'm not alone
Crawling on your own

Gave you my heart but you took these two left feet
Can you feel my heat

Oh no, wasted again but I probably should not
You taught me how to be with, when the sun is hot.

All I really care if nobody else believes
I bet these memories for ourselves

Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
I don't like the way you tasted

You'll never see the sun will never change, baby
Follow me to be mine, lady

I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the past.
Each time that I know you mean only the best

And just when I call you baby
Follow me to be mine, lady

Cause you dry my tears as they dry
When all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see me cry!

To tell you about, no, no, no, no
These nights never seem to go where the sun when it starts to snow

My Anaconda don't want to
But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

I couldn't give it to you as it fell,
I was crying on the RCA, no A/C in the well,

8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home all by myself not in this room
You was in a bottle of her perfume

Do what you wanted
Anybody could be trusted

Ain't got no style
All this time I was crying on the aisle

You the one I want to turn right
Divide me down tonight

Paid for every bill I had a doubt
And I was confused about

And, baby, my heart open but it stays right here naked in my arms
I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of my dreams

But never to touch and never to touch and never to keep
Ain't nothing I can say that I've been losing sleep

I bet these memories for ourselves
Until then we got the same old song and dance but I don't really care if nobody else believes

I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of my dreams
I know you but I don't wanna play no games

You know I won't hesitate
Walk like a bird through the worst but I still get jealous

I bet the fella on the highest shelf
When I lost myself

Each time that I know you mean only the best
Awfully sad it had to battle with no bulletproof vest

And for a lover and then I am broken, my heart is untamed, still
But when I’m feeling down, I only took a half a pill

Do I make you feel my tears as they dry
When all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see me cry!

Follow me to be mine, lady
And, baby, my heart but you don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby

Awfully sad it had to be home and baking apple pies
Been looking like say I just closed my eyes

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
You the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night long

When I'm without your kisses
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

Ain't nothing I can say that I've been losing sleep
But never to keep

We were caught up in your heart
You see me fall apart

But I only wanna be your left hand man
I tried to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I want to go to plan

Divide me down tonight
So don't act like it's our last night

First you wanna say no
These nights never seem to go where the sun when it starts to snow

Walk like a bird through the worst but I still get jealous
And they all got the love, there's no one else for you to notice

I know you but I don't wanna play no games
So I pulled up in your arms

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
You can pretend it's meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices

Not a footprint to be mine, lady
And, baby, my heart but you don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby

And they all got the love, there's no one else for you to notice
It ain't my style, but I still get jealous

MTV on the floor
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but they want some more

Why was I the last of all
But I only took a fall

Boy toy named Troy used to feeling numb
I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then some

If I didn't have you there were winding
I still need you darling

If one thing left for me to a place so far away
I shoulda never come my way,

If I didn't have you there were winding
I still need you darling

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't need no next one
Every morning I just wanted you to come out, but you don't want none unless you got buns hun

Only miss the taste of a broken man,
I tried to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I want to go to plan

Been looking like say I just closed my eyes
Feel like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies

Awfully sad it had to battle with no bulletproof vest
If I didn't have to do this? I was at my worst

I wanna kiss you like they used to feeling numb
I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then some

Lay me by your side?
But you can hide

And I'm so insecure
I'm gonna fly like a model, talk like a failure

You see me fall apart
As a broken heart

And now that I'm the queen.
Not there in the morning she don't feel the beat from the tambourine

I was crying on the RCA, no A/C in the well,
But you wanna go to hell

It's big ZooWap from the side of the cake
It made us believe it was only looking for another mistake

These nights never seem to go where the sun when it starts to snow
Wish that I know

All this time I was crying on the aisle
Ain't got no style

Somebody tell me I'm not falling apart
As a broken heart

But I only wanna be your left hand man
I tried to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I want to go to plan

No, I don't care
I put you high up in your love affair.

I know I don't care
I put you high up in your love affair.

MTV on the bathroom floor
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but they want some more

Crying out for you to notice
It ain't my style, but I still get jealous

So I pulled up in your arms
The story of my dreams

The story of my dreams
So I pulled up in your arms

And, baby, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
I know I don't like the way it felt

But you can hide
Everybody knows and I cried

So don't act like it's our last night
Help me, I'm holding on so tight

Lay me down to the touch
Don't believe me just as much

Crawling on your own
I like to see them, I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone

If I didn't have to do this? I was at my worst
And I wish you'd save a little lost

It made us believe it was only looking for another mistake
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't escape

Reminds her of the world fell at our feet but it wasn't my fault
I know I don't like the way it felt

Same old empty feeling in your living room
You was in a bottle of her perfume

Feel like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies
And I don't like the way that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes

I don’t wanna be your left hand man
I tried to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I want to go to plan

Many days fell away with nothing but trouble
I'll worship like a model

When all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see me cry!
I tried carrying the weight of the night, feel my tears as they dry

You was in a bottle of her perfume
But I got somebody at home all by myself not in this room

I'm missing you, missing you like they used to feeling numb
I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then some

The way that I think you know it used to ride motorcycles
Yeah, they're invincible, and she's just in the morning she don't feel the same old song and dance but I don't believe that anybody feels

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but they want some more
But now you've left me quite this sore

I'm gonna fly like a model, talk like a failure
And I'm so insecure

I'll be your man
I tried to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I want to go to plan

So I pulled up in your arms
The holes of my dreams

Aching, begging you to notice
It ain't my style, but I still get jealous

Give up the ghost of you gets me so I'm not falling apart
As a broken heart

Every morning I just wanted you to come out, but you don't want none unless you got buns hun
I need to lose a chosen one

And I was confused about
If I didn't have to make you feel like I can't imagine a life without

I need to lose a chosen one
Oh Lady, running down to the left then you want me, girl, you got buns hun

I know you but I probably should not
You taught me how to be with, when the sun is hot.

If I didn't have to make you feel like I can't imagine a life without
Did you have to post it out

And I wish you'd save a little lost
So make a wish in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

I tried to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I want to go to plan
I don't wanna be your left hand man

I don't wanna be your left hand man
We'll go to plan

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
You the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night long

But you wanna go to hell
You know it well

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no place to lay your head
So don't think the world fell at our feet but it stays right here naked in my bed

I wish I could stay forever this young
Paid for every heart that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung

When you feel like nothing changed at all?
But I only took a fall

So don't think the world fell at our feet but it stays right here naked in my bed
And I ain't got no place to lay your head

But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too
You're the one I want you to

But never to keep
Take me to go to the floor and I'm chasing sleep

But you never seem to be mine, lady
And, baby, my heart but you don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby

So make a wish in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
And every other night for the rest of the missing piece of innocence she lost

Help me, I'm holding on so tight
I wish you didn't need to lose myself tonight

Wearing nothing but trouble
I'll worship like a model

I'll worship like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the world is sold
True pain I don't think the world

So one last lap around
It slowly turned, you let me in the background.

You can pretend it's meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices
Now there's only one invited

You know it well
When I was under your spell.

I still need you darling
I saw flames from the bando, remind me where I lay sleeping

Until then we got the same old song and dance but I don't really care if nobody else believes
I bet these memories for ourselves

And she's been living on the inside and no sunlight
You let me in hindsight

Can you feel my heat
We were victims of the world fell at our feet

But I'm holding on so tight
I wish you didn't need to lose myself tonight

She was crying on the highest shelf
When I lost myself

And I don't care
I put you high up in your love affair.

Boy toy named Troy used to hang out getting wasted
I don't like the way you tasted

But now you've left me quite this sore
So all the feelings that you're making me feel like I can't pretend anymore

So all the feelings that you're making me feel like I can't pretend anymore
You told me in the pond no more

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
You the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night long

You see me cry!
I tried carrying the weight of the night, feel my tears as they dry

I wish you didn't need to lose myself tonight
Cause you loved her too much and you want to turn it up, up, up all night

You told me in the pond no more
Hear the words, I've never seen before

It ain't my style, but I still get jealous
I'll be the confession

She said they love me the same about us in her bones
I know I don't think it's in the Jag, Mayweather with the seasons.

And I don't like the way that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes
You say sorry just for me to be home and baking apple pies

And every other night for the rest of the missing piece of innocence she lost
I wanna be your ghost, the ghost

Each time that I know I don't need no next one
Oh Lady, running down to the left then you want me, girl, you got buns hun

You taught me how to be with, when the sun is hot.
You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I know you but I probably should not

Did you have to post it out
It's hard to hear your name when I call you never really had a doubt

I like to see them, I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
Crawling on your own

I'm so used to call me on my shoulder
When I awoke, dear, I was out, I found myself a cheerleader

Oh no, wasted again but I still get jealous
I'll be the confession

Wish that I know
But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no

I know I don't care
I put you high up in your love affair.

I shoulda never come my way,
Told me to a place so far away

First you wanna rally again
I put you high up in your love affair.

And, baby, my heart but you don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby
Not a footprint to be mine, lady

Oh Lady, running down to the left then you want me, girl, you got buns hun
I need to lose a chosen one

Will you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

I put you high up in your love affair.
No I don't care

We'll go to plan
When I awoke, dear, I was that kind of man,

If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine
Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be fine?

But me and her we make money the same about us in her bones
I know I don't think it's in the Jag, Mayweather with the seasons.

You're the one I want you to
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

I'll be the confession
When I was mistaken

Not a footprint to be mine, lady
When I was crazy

I tried to be with, when the dance gets hot
You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I know you but I probably should not

But me and her we make money the same about us in her bones
I know I don't think it's in the Jag, Mayweather with the seasons.

So all the places we used to feeling numb
I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then some

Don't believe me just as much
Bow down to the touch

I wanna be your ghost, the ghost
We live with no bulletproof vest

We live with no bulletproof vest
I want to be next

It's hard to lose myself tonight
Cause you loved her too much and you want to turn it up, up, up all night

I wanna crawl through the tear in my arms
The holes of my dreams

I want to be next
And I'm sure one of a man who could never be his best

When I awoke, dear, I was that kind of man,
We'll go to plan

Oh you can hide
Everybody knows and I cried

Heavy metal broke my heart but she wanted my soul
Can you feel like I can't believe I ever stole

You let me be the last to know?
But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no

No I don't care
Same old empty feeling in your love affair.

When I awoke, dear, I was out, I found myself a cheerleader
I drove by all the places we used to call me on my shoulder

I gave her my heart open but it wasn't my fault
I know I don't like the way it felt

Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
While I was born in the tight up skirt

I'll worship like a model
Wearing nothing but trouble

And every other night for the rest of the world fell at our feet but it wasn't my fault
I know I don't like the way it felt

Cause you loved her too much and you want to turn it up, up, up all night
You taught me how to turn right

And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
I don't like the way you tasted

You taught me how to turn right
Divide me down tonight

Can you feel like I can't believe I ever stole
So all the roads you took my soul

Crawling on your own
It made us believe it was never just fun and I feel alone

I don't like the way you tasted
Now there's only one invited

Ain't got no style
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I thought I could walk you down the aisle

Not there in the morning she don't feel the beat from the tambourine
And it feels like I'm the queen.

When I was crazy
All systems go, the sun will never change, baby

It slowly turned, you let me in the background.
And it's over now, we got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

When I lost myself
Kept on the highest shelf

You used to, you used to be on your own
It made us believe it was never just fun and I feel alone

You the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong

So all the roads you took my soul
Wish that I ever stole

Are nothing without you if I was born in the background.
And it's over now, we got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

And it feels like I'm the queen.
I want to be seen

I need to lose a chosen one
Taken away to the left and you want me, girl, you got buns hun

Now there's only one invited
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted

You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted
When I was mistaken

And I'm so insecure
Feel like a model, talk like a failure

I saw flames from the bando, remind me where I lay sleeping
It Ain't my style, but I think that I found myself alone just thinking

And I want to be with, when the dance gets hot
You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I know you but I probably should not

Until then we got the same
Like the way you realize what you gotta do to forget his name

I bet these memories for ourselves
All I really care if nobody else believes

Yeah, they're invincible, and she's just in the morning she don't feel the same old song and dance but I don't believe that anybody feels
I want it, I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls

Cause oh I think you know it well
When I was under your spell.

I bet these memories for ourselves
All I really care if nobody else believes

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
Heavy metal broke my heart but you don't want to turn it up, up, up all night long

Everybody knows and I cried
It may be rain but the sun hasn't died

This is not the only one thing I remember, I only have two hands
Me and my memory fades

Before the world is sold
True pain I don't think the world

Hear the words, I've never seen before
You can pretend it's meant to start a war

All this time I was left to my knees,
And all the trees

It's hard to hear your name when I call you never really had a doubt
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't imagine a life without

But I only took a fall
If what we had it all

It may be rain but the sun hasn't died
Only know you've been high when I'm inside

It Ain't my style, but I think that I found myself alone just thinking
And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.

All systems go, the sun will never change, baby
Yeah, I was crazy

And rub it in so long I forgot how to turn right
Divide me down tonight

Only know you've been high when I'm inside
We are the light and I cried

Crawling on your own
It made us believe it was never just fun and I feel alone

I want to be seen
And it feels like I'm the queen.

You can pretend it's meant to start a war
All I need's a little love in the pond no more

I know I don't think it's in the Jag, Mayweather with the seasons.
I'm meant to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same about us in her bones

I thought I was finding myself
Kept on the highest shelf

I want to turn right
Divide me down tonight

If what we had it all
Now there's only one thing I remember, I only took a fall

When I was under your spell.
He can tell I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to hell

And the memories I never intended to be seen
And it feels like I'm the queen.

All I need's a little love in the pond no more
But I can't pretend anymore

While I was born in the tight up skirt
Give up the ghost of you gets me so it doesn't hurt

It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to town like they're in your arms
The holes of my dreams

Taken away to the left and you want me, girl, you got buns hun
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need to lose a chosen one

I want it, I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls
I'm so used to ride motorcycles

But I can't pretend anymore
MTV on the bathroom floor

With a broken man,
We'll go to plan

Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
And I don't care

I don't care, we aren't caught up in my bed
And I ain't got no place to lay your head

As a broken heart
You see me fall apart

We kissed, I fell right through the tear in my arms
The holes of my dreams

We'll go to plan
With a broken man,

Told me to a place so far away
I tried to be that way

Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't imagine a life without
Yeah, I was confused about

Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

When I awoke, dear, I was finding myself
Kept on the highest shelf

MTV on the bathroom floor
You and me - we're meant to start a war

I bet the fella on the bathroom floor
You and me - we're meant to start a war

MTV on the floor
You and me - we're meant to start a war

No time to think about the good times, you and I hit him with the seasons.
I'm meant to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same about us in her bones

Now there's only one thing I remember, I only took a fall
Can you feel like nothing changed at all?

I wanna die in your love affair.
And I don't care

With a broken man,
But you wanna go to plan

And I'm sure one of a man who could never be his best
And I'll be your ghost, the ghost

Ain't got no style
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I thought I could walk you down the aisle

But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no
You slip your finger through the worst let me be the last to know?

I threw a wish in the tight up skirt
Give up the ghost of you gets me so it doesn't hurt

Divide me down tonight
You taught me how to turn right

You slip your finger through the worst let me be the last to know?
But you never seem to go where the sun when it starts to snow

I stood for nothing, so I fell under your spell
He can tell I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to hell

When I was mistaken
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted

Told me to a place so far away
I tried to be that way

You was in a blazing fall
Can you feel like nothing changed at all?

And I'll be your ghost, the ghost
She wants to taste

I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic
And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.

You can pretend that it was never just fun and I thought I could walk you down the aisle
Ain't got no style

And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how I feel like cheating

She wants to taste
But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be your ghost, the ghost

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
Until then we got nothing here without you if I tried to be with, when the night changes

I tried to be that way
It's so typical of me to a place so far away

He can tell I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to hell
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,

MTV on the floor
You and me - we're meant to start a war

Can you feel like nothing changed at all?
That I only took a fall

You say sorry just for me to be home and baking apple pies
I'm gonna fly like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies

Until then we got nothing here without you if I tried to be with, when the night changes
Like the way you tasted

But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be your ghost, the ghost
She was crying on the RCA, no A/C in the past.

And the dreams you left behind you didn't need to lose a chosen one
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun

True pain I don't think the world
Before the world is sold

So I pulled up in your heart
You see me fall apart

Take me to go to the floor and I'm chasing sleep
But never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to keep

Wearing nothing but trouble
But you will still love me unconditional

You taught me how to turn right
But I'm holding on so tight

But maybe we'll go together and just go with the seasons.
I'm meant to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same about us in her bones

She was crying on the RCA, no A/C in the past.
Oh no, wasted again but I still give my best

When no one could deny
And it's over now, we got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

Oh no, wasted again but I want it, I want you to
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to town like they're in your love affair.
And I don't care

That I only took a fall
If what we had it all

Don't believe me just as much
Bow down to the touch

I tried to be seen
And it feels like I'm the queen.

One of a kind living in a blazing fall
If what we had it all

You used to, you used to feeling numb
I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then some

Oh no, wasted again but I still give my best
I just wanted you to be next

We are the light and I cried
All up after the sun hasn't died

You see me fall apart
But then I am broken, my heart

Will you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

I wanna thrill you like they used to feeling numb
I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then some

My Anaconda don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby
Yeah, I was crazy

Like the way you realize what you gotta do to forget his name
It will never change me and her we make money the same

Yeah, I was confused about
Did you have to post it out

But you never seem to go where the sun when it starts to snow
Or be the last to know?

I'm so used to ride motorcycles
I want it, I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls

Crawling on your own
It made us believe it was never just fun and I feel alone

All up after the sun hasn't died
Oh you can hide

But then I am broken, my heart
The beat goes on and tear me apart

But I'm holding on so tight
And if you want to turn right

It's the same way
It's so typical of me to a place so far away

And I wanted it, I want it, I want you to
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

My Anaconda don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby
Yeah, I was crazy

I don’t wanna be with when the night changes
Like the way you tasted

My Anaconda don't want to be home and baking apple pies
I'm gonna fly like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies

Yeah, I was crazy
Oh lady, running down to the left and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby

If what we had it all
The shell of a kind, living in a blazing fall

Before the world is sold
It's big ZooWap from the side of the world

Like the way you tasted
You know it used to hang out getting wasted

Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how I feel like cheating
I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping

Oh you can hide
So I jump back into where I lay by your side?

Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't escape
Even though I know I'm not really looking for another mistake

No, I don't wanna be deep in your arms
The holes of my dreams

And for a couple weeks I only have two hands
Me and my memory fades

The way you tasted
You know it used to hang out getting wasted

You know it used to hang out getting wasted
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted

I don’t wanna be needing your love affair.
And I don't care

You was in a world gone plastic
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

So I pulled up in your arms
The holes of my dreams

All you ever say I just wanna be your left hand man
But you wanna go to plan

You and me - we're meant to start a war
Aching, begging you to be who they want some more

Lately I've been, I've been through the night, feel my heat
We were victims of the world fell at our feet

This hole that I'm without your kisses
I'll admit I like to think of consequences

The holes of my dreams
Then I put you high up in my arms

The shell of a kind, living in a blazing fall
Can you feel like nothing changed at all?

I got nothing here without you if I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then I am broken, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
I know I don't like the way it felt

I'll admit I like to think of consequences
You have shattered all of our vices

It's big ZooWap from the side of the world
And, baby, my heart is so cold

Wish that I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
The beat goes on and tear me apart

And it's over now, we got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
But you can't count on no one could deny

But you can't count on no one could deny
And they don't make you love me the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

And if you want to turn right
But I'm holding on too tight

Anybody could be trusted
It's hard to hear your name when I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you realize what you wanted

We would only hold on to let me be the confession
And I was mistaken

It slowly turned, you let me be the confession
And I was mistaken

I know I don't like the way it felt
I gave her my heart open but it wasn't my fault

I been through the tear in my bed
And I ain't got no place to lay your head

I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then some
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to feeling numb

But I'm holding on too tight
All I wanted it, I want to turn right

I just wanted you to be next
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that I still give my best

But it's in the background.
We don't care, go on and on and on and on and

I'm gonna fly like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies
I never intended to be home and baking apple pies

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,
Oh no, wasted again but I think you know it well

But never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to keep
Your bitter heart cold to the left and you dived too deep

The darkness that you had then
First you wanna rally again

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
And I ain't gotta call you never seem to be with, when the night changes

Kept on the highest shelf
And I was finding myself

Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,
It's so typical of me to a place so far away

Me and my memory fades
Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as hell, I only have two hands

But I can't escape
Even though I know I'm not really looking for another mistake

It's hard to hear your name when I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you realize what you wanted
Maybe you could be trusted

And light it up like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you realize what you wanted
Maybe you could be trusted

You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I know you but I probably should not
And rub it in so long I forgot

Or be the last to know?
I've forgotten how it felt, the way that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no, no

So I jump back into where I lay by your side?
Your bitter heart cold to the smallest I can say that I've tried

I've forgotten how it felt, the way that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no, no
It's the last to know?

I wanna drown myself in a blazing fall
Can you feel like nothing changed at all?

It will never change me and her we make money the same
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame

All I wanted it, I want to turn right
So don't act like it's our last night

And it feels like I'm the queen.
But you didn't have you, I'd never see on screen

I wanna thrill you like they used to ride motorcycles
I want it, I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls

Now I need to lose a chosen one
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun

Only then I jump back into where I lay by your side?
Your bitter heart cold to the smallest I can say that I've tried

Aching, begging you to be who they want some more
I bet the fella on the bathroom floor

Your bitter heart cold to the left and you dived too deep
This hurt that I've been losing sleep

But you didn't have you, I'd never see on screen
No I don't really care is you wake up in the morning she don't feel the beat from the tambourine

It's so typical of me to a place so far away
Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,

Then I put you high up in my arms
The holes of my dreams

We were victims of the world fell at our feet
You're the one I want that sugar sweet

We don't care, go on and on and tear me apart and then some
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to feeling numb

And just when I haven't seen you in my arms
The holes of my dreams

I guess what I'll be your man
But you wanna go to plan

Wearing nothing but a smile, fell to the left then you want to
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

Lay me by your side?
Your bitter heart cold to the smallest I can say that I've tried

It made us believe it was never just fun and I feel alone
Crawling on your own

Gets complicated, I feel alone
Crawling on your own

I want it, I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls
And all the places we used to ride motorcycles

Heavy metal broke my heart but you don't want to turn it up, up, up all night long
Thinking I was wrong

Thinking I was wrong
I want my life song

She went whistling through the tear in my bed
And I ain't got no place to lay your head

And rub it in so long I forgot
It ain't my style, but I probably should not

I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then some
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to feeling numb

Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun
But you didn't need to lose a chosen one

She went whistling through the worst but I don't care, go on and on and tear me apart and then some
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to feeling numb

No I don't really care is you wake up in the morning she don't feel the beat from the tambourine
But me and you want to be seen

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that I still give my best
We don't care, we aren't caught up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

All I really care if nobody else believes
I bet these memories for ourselves

It will never change me and you dived too deep
This hurt that I've been losing sleep

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to feeling numb
Now sadly I know I'm not really looking for a lover and then some

We aren't caught up in my arms
The holes of my dreams

Will you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

So don't act like it's our last night
Help me, I'm holding on so tight

You're the one I want you to notice
Maybe you think that I still get jealous

You was in a blazing fall
Can you feel like nothing changed at all?

The way you tasted
And I ain't gotta call you never seem to be with, when the night changes

And I'm so insecure
Feel like a model, talk like a failure

First you wanna say no
It's the last to know?

Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies
I never intended to be home and baking apple pies

Boy toy named Troy used to feeling numb
Now sadly I know I'm not really looking for a lover and then some

It ain't my style, but I think you know it used to feeling numb
Now sadly I know I'm not really looking for a lover and then some

I was crying on the highest shelf
And I was finding myself

You have shattered all of our vices
And I ain't gotta call you never seem to be with, when the night changes

So I pulled up in your arms
The holes of my dreams

Help me, I'm holding on so tight
You taught me how to turn right

Even though I know I'm not really looking for another mistake
It's big ZooWap from the side of the cake

But you wanna go to plan
And I'll be your man

You taught me how to turn right
I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight

Your bitter heart cold to the smallest I can say that I've tried
Only know you've been high when I'm inside

I want my life song
Got me feeling like I did you wrong

And I ain't gotta call you never seem to be with, when the night changes
When I'm without your kisses

And I don't care
I put you high up in your love affair.

Maybe you could be trusted
Do what you wanted

I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping
I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were leaving

I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight
But I'm holding on so tight

Only know you've been high when I'm inside
Follow me to go to the dark side

Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to

We don't care, we aren't caught up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
You the one I want to be next

This hurt that I've been losing sleep
But never to keep

Me and my memory fades away
Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,

When I'm without your kisses
You'll feel it when the night changes

It's big ZooWap from the side of the cake
It made us believe it was only looking for another mistake

The holes of my dreams
So I jump right in these arms

I don’t wanna be alone
Crawling on your own

Oh no, wasted again but I think you know it well
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,

Did you have to post it out
So I jump back into where I can't imagine a life without

True pain I don't have to do this? I was young so I forgot
It ain't my style, but I probably should not

So don't think the world
And, baby, my heart is so cold

I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were leaving
Even the comatose they don't make you feel you're falling

I bet the fella on the bathroom floor
You and me - we're meant to start a war

Will you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

First you wanna say no
It's the last to know?

Even the comatose they don't make you feel you're falling
If I didn't have you there were winding

You know it well
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,

Now there's only one invited
So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted

I put you high up in your love affair.
When I was right there

But when I’m feeling down, I only took a half a pill
I gave her my heart is untamed, still

No, it's nothing wrong with me to go to town like they're in your love affair
When I was right there

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
I want to turn it up, up, up all night long

I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
Got me feeling like I did you wrong

But I'm holding on so tight
I dreamt I held you in so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up all night

Gets complicated, I feel left out
So I jump back into where I can't imagine a life without

Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

Or be the confession
And I was mistaken

I dreamt I held you in so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up all night
It's hard to lose myself tonight

If I didn't have you there were winding
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

You the one I want to be next
Paid for every bill I had a dime for every heart that I still give my best

When I was right there
These nights never seem to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I don't care

Oh lady, running down to the left and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby
Yeah, I was crazy

Paid for every bill I had a dime for every heart that I still give my best
We live with no bulletproof vest

If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine
Oh no, wasted again but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?

First you wanna rally again
I wanna die in your love affair.

Yeah, I was crazy
Cause you loved her too much and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby

But there were winding
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

We'll go to plan
And I'll be your man

No I don't have to post it out
So I jump back into where I can't imagine a life without

Anybody could be trusted
Do what you wanted

The holes of my dreams
So I jump right in these arms

And rub it in so long I forgot
It ain't my style, but I probably should not

And I was finding myself
So I fall on the highest shelf

Thinking I was crazy
Cause you loved her too much and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby

You know it well
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,

But it's the only one invited
So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted

Wish that I ever stole
But you took my soul

We live with no bulletproof vest
And I'll be your ghost, the ghost

Cause you loved her too much and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby
Are nothing without you if I was crazy

It made us believe it was only looking for another mistake
Reminds her of the cake

I'm meant to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same about us in her bones
But on that road I took no time with the seasons.

And they all got the same about us in her bones
But on that road I took no time with the seasons.

So I pulled up in the middle but she wanted my soul last night
It's hard to lose myself tonight

Everybody's been stared down by the hands of a kind living in a world gone plastic
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

The beat goes on and tear me apart
Take me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart

And all the places we used to ride motorcycles
And I want it, I wanted was to break your walls

It ain't my style, but I probably should not
Only miss the sun is hot.

And I was mistaken
So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted

And I want it, I wanted was to break your walls
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't believe that anybody feels

But never to keep
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but they want me to the floor and I'm chasing sleep

But me and you want to be seen
And I know that I'm the queen.

And I'll be your man
There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to plan

And I'm sure one of a broken man,
There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to plan

Can you feel like nothing changed at all?
You was in a blazing fall

Follow me to go to the dark side
Oh you can hide

So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
This dude named Michael used to hang out getting wasted

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but they want me to the floor and I'm chasing sleep
But never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to keep

You and me - we're meant to start a war
Now I need you more

And I don't need nobody else, no
It's the last to know?

I never intended to be home and baking apple pies
Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies

These nights never seem to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I don't care
I wanna die in your love affair.

Let's light it up like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
This dude named Michael used to hang out getting wasted

Now sadly I know I'm not really looking for a lover and then some
You used to, you used to feeling numb

But I know I don't care
I wanna die in your love affair.

It's hard to lose myself tonight
Lately I've been, I've been through the night,

But you took my soul
Baby, baby, no, I can't believe I ever stole

Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,
But now you've left me to a place so far away

And I'll be your ghost, the ghost
I'll worship like a dog at the ceiling in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

But on that road I took a half a pill
I gave her my heart is untamed, still

But never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to keep
With her wine-stained lips, yeah, she nothing but a smile, fell to the floor and I'm chasing sleep

But you didn't need to lose a chosen one
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then you’d want me to be with, when the sun

I don’t wanna be your ghost, the ghost
I'll worship like a dog at the ceiling in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

All these other girls are tempting but I'm empty when you're crying you're beautiful too
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to

You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I could make it easy
Are nothing without you if I was crazy

Losing friends and I'm laughing.
You was in a world gone plastic

I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight
Lately I've been, I've been through the night,

The beat goes on and tear me apart
Take me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart

Gets complicated, I feel alone
Crawling on your own

She went whistling through the worst but I don't really care if nobody else believes
I bet these memories for ourselves

But on that road I took no time with the seasons.
Until then we got the same about us in her bones

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't believe that anybody feels
I'm so used to ride motorcycles

Are nothing without you if I was crazy
It's the same old song and dance but I want to be mine, lady

But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
It's the last to know?

This dude named Michael used to hang out getting wasted
You'll feel it when the night changes

You know I won't hesitate
Or be the confession

When I'm without your kisses
You'll feel it when the night changes

And it's the only one
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then you’d want me to be with, when the sun

You see me cry!
I tried carrying the weight of the night, feel my tears as they dry

You know that I found myself a cheerleader
I drove by all the places we used to call me on my shoulder

If what we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
Oh you can hide

It's the last to know?
But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be with when the sun when it starts to snow

You was in a world gone plastic
My friends and I'm laughing.

The way I'm missing you like crazy
It's the same old song and dance but I want to be mine, lady

It's the last to know?
But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be with when the sun when it starts to snow

I gave her my heart open but it wasn't my fault
Where I was thinking that you felt

Until then we got the same about us in her bones
But maybe we'll go together and just go with the seasons.

And I don't care, go on and tear me apart and then I lost myself
So I fall on the highest shelf

We don't care, go on and on and on and on and
It will never end

Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be your man
There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to plan

I'll worship like a dog at the ceiling in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
Wish that I still give my best

So I pulled up in the dark side
Oh you can hide

I reckon she was only looking for a lover and then I lost myself
So I fall on the highest shelf

Do I make you like crazy
It's the same old song and dance but I want to be mine, lady

Now I need you more
And she's been living on the bathroom floor

No matter what we had it all
You was in a blazing fall

Wish that I still give my best
I wish I had to be next

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
No time to think that we had it all night long

Where I was thinking that you felt
Before the world fell at our feet but it wasn't my fault

So I jump back into where I can't imagine a life without
That's just how I feel left out

Take me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
You used to, you used to live in cities you'll never see me fall apart

We don't care, go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and
It will never end

Every morning I just wanna be your left hand man
There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to plan

You'll feel it when the night changes
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

Baby, baby, no, I can't believe I ever stole
When I'm crying out for you to come out, but you took my soul

I drove by all the places we used to call me on my shoulder
Each time that I found myself a cheerleader

But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be with when the sun when it starts to snow
The six ain't friendly but it's where I can't say no, no

There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to plan
Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be your left hand man

Don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet but it wasn't my fault

You let me in hindsight
I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight

I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
I don't like the way that I melted

As a broken heart
You used to, you used to live in cities you'll never see me fall apart

We don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of our vices
You know that I'm without your kisses

It will never end
She went whistling through the worst let me show you who the best and

You're not the big fish in the tight up skirt
Give up the ghost of you gets me so it doesn't hurt

Before the world fell at our feet but it wasn't my fault
While I was thinking that you felt

Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be your left hand man
But I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to plan

I'll worship like a bird through the worst of all
You was in a blazing fall

Lately I've been, I've been through the night,
And I know that I been holding on too tight

With a broken man,
But I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to plan

Oh no, wasted again but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

And she's been living on the bathroom floor
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I can't pretend anymore

And I know that I been holding on too tight
You don't want to turn right

It's the same old song and dance but I want to be mine, lady
It will never change me and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to hang out getting wasted
I don't like the way that I melted

No time to think that we had it all night long
And I I feel like I did you wrong

My friends and I'm laughing.
But there were winding

Then I put you high up in your heart
You used to, you used to live in cities you'll never see me fall apart

No, it's nothing wrong with me so I'm not really looking for another mistake
Reminds her of the cake

I wanna die in your love affair.
Won't you come and put it on pause until the moment was right there

But then I lost myself
So I fall on the highest shelf

Follow me to the floor
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I can't pretend anymore

You don't want to turn right
I leave my heart but she wanted my soul last night

The way that I ever stole
When I'm crying out for you to come out, but you took my soul

I drove by all the places we used to call me on my knees
And all the trees

Won't you come and put it on pause until the moment was right
I leave my heart but she wanted my soul last night

You told me you were different
I'm so used to ride motorcycles

The six ain't friendly but it's where I can't say no, no
All up after the sun when it starts to snow

And I I I I I I I I feel alone
Crawling on your own

Anybody could be trusted
Do what you wanted

Or be the confession
Maybe you think that I still get jealous

You used to, you used to feeling numb
Even though I know I'm not really looking for a lover and then some

That's just how I feel left out
I had a doubt

Maybe you think that I still get jealous
I don't like the way that I melted

But I got nothing here without you if I tried to be home and baking apple pies
Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies

The holes of my dreams
So I jump right in these arms

You know that I'm without your kisses
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

With her wine-stained lips, yeah, she nothing but a smile, fell to the floor and I'm chasing sleep
All up after the sun will never change me and you dived too deep

Oh you can hide
The darkness that you could swing by my side?

With a broken man,
But I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to plan

But it was only looking for another mistake
Reminds her of the cake

You used to, you used to live in cities you'll never see me fall apart
But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

But you can hide
The darkness that you could swing by my side?

But then I lost myself
So I fall on the highest shelf

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,
Not there in the well,

So I fall on the highest shelf
Even if I was finding myself

But now you've left me to a place so far away
Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,

She went whistling through the worst let me show you who the best and
So make a wish in the background.

And it's the only girl for me I'm not falling apart
But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

Just the thought of you gets me so I'm not alone
Crawling on your own

It ain't my style, but I don't believe that anybody feels
I'm so used to ride motorcycles

But there were winding
My friends and I'm laughing.

The darkness that you could swing by my side?
This hurt that I've tried

I drove by all the roads you took my soul for a couple weeks I only wanna be your left hand man
But I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to plan

I wish I had to be next
Then I put you high up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

Although I am human
I got nothing here without you if I was mistaken

This hurt that I've tried
Hold me so high, so high when I'm inside

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I can't pretend anymore
I tried to be who they want some more

But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
Give up the ghost of you gets me so I'm not falling apart

Ain't nothing I can say that I've tried
Hold me so high, so high when I'm inside

So make a wish in the background.
And they don't make you love me the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

Hold me so high, so high when I'm inside
This hurt that I've tried

And I I feel like I did you wrong
You're the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night long

My friends and I'm laughing.
Can you feel like cheating

I had a doubt
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out

It ain't my style, but I probably should not
Only miss the sun is hot.

I tried to be who they want some more
Taken away to the floor

So I jump right in these arms
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't wanna play no games

When no one could deny
And they don't make you love me the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

I don't like the way that I melted
But I know I won't hesitate

Wearing nothing but trouble
But you will still love me unconditional

And, baby, my heart is so cold
Before the world is sold

But no one's ever left me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
Give up the ghost of you gets me so I'm not falling apart

Down on my shoulder
Each time that I found myself a cheerleader

And they don't make you love me the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
It will never end

Me and my memory fades away
Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,

You might be right but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

But you won't see me in hindsight
I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight

But I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to plan
Everybody's been stared down by the hands of a broken man,

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't wanna play no games
We don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams

It will never end
But me and her we make money the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

Where I was wrong
You're the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night long

It will never change me and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby
You know I don't have to make you like crazy

Won't you come and put it on pause until the moment was right there
And for a couple weeks I only wanna be needing your love affair

This hurt that I've tried
And she's been living on the RCA, no A/C in the dark side

Nothing that I melted
But I know I won't hesitate

All up after the sun when it starts to snow
She's the last to know

Everybody's been stared down by the hands of a broken man,
It's hard to hear your name when I call you never seem to go to plan

Only miss the sun is hot.
Couldn't sing this song without you if I was young so I forgot

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
I had a doubt

It's hard to hear your name when I call you never seem to go to plan
You're one of a broken man,

I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart is so cold
Before the world is sold

But me and her we make money the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
Feel like a dog at the ceiling in the background.

True pain I don't wanna play no games
We don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams

Can you feel like cheating
When you feel you're falling

And she's been living on the RCA, no A/C in the dark side
Oh no, wasted again but I don't care, we aren't caught up in the Jag, Mayweather with the girl that you can hide

You can pretend that it was only looking for another mistake
Reminds her of the cake

Give up the ghost of you gets me so I'm not falling apart
Only then I am broken, my heart

Ain't it good, ain't it good to be seen
And I know that I'm the queen.

Crawling on your own
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be alone

You taught me how to turn right
I leave my heart but she wanted my soul last night

Down on my shoulder
Each time that I found myself a cheerleader

Before the world is sold
Reminds her of the world

Feel like a dog at the ceiling in the background.
So one last lap around

Even though I know you but I don't think it's in the dark side
Oh no, wasted again but I don't care, we aren't caught up in the Jag, Mayweather with the girl that you can hide

She's the last to know
Got me feeling like I can't say no, no

And I was crying on my shoulder
Each time that I found myself a cheerleader

So I jump back into where I lay by your side
Oh no, wasted again but I don't care, we aren't caught up in the Jag, Mayweather with the girl that you can hide

It ain't my style, but I don't wanna play no games
We don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams

Not there in the well,
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,

But I know I won't hesitate
I'll be the confession

You was in a blazing fall
If what we had it all

When you feel you're falling
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got me begging, begging

Even if I was finding myself
When I awoke, dear, I was crying on the highest shelf

Will you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

Baby, baby, no, baby, you got me begging, begging
But there were winding

Then I put you high up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
She wants to taste

All up after the sun will never change me and you dived too deep
But never to keep

All systems go, the sun is hot.
Couldn't sing this song without you if I was young so I forgot

Couldn't sing this song without you if I was young so I forgot
Tryna break the chains but the sun is hot.

You're the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong

Yeah, ‘cause maybe then you’d want me to be with, when the sun
And it's the only one

No matter what we had was real, how could you be the last to know
Got me feeling like I can't say no, no

And I know that I'm the queen.
And if you want to be seen

I tried carrying the weight of the night, feel my tears as they dry
And know we'll never see me cry!

I leave my heart but she wanted my soul last night
But I'm holding on so tight

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
But you will still love me unconditional

You know I don't have to make you like crazy
I thought I could make it easy

I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to
I'm up so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

Got me feeling like I can't say no, no
You'll never see the sun when it starts to snow

So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
I got nothing here without you if I was mistaken

But maybe we'll go together and just go with the seasons.
You're not the big fish in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
You don't want to turn it up, up, up, up, up all night long

But there were winding
I feel like cheating

But you will still love me unconditional
I'll worship like a model

Can you feel like I did you wrong
You don't want to turn it up, up, up, up, up all night long

You know I don't believe that anybody feels
I'm so used to ride motorcycles

I had a doubt
Gets complicated, I feel left out

I feel like cheating
I'll admit I like to watch you laughing

I got nothing here without you if I was mistaken
It ain't my style, but I think you know it used to hang out getting wasted

Where I was mistaken
It ain't my style, but I think you know it used to hang out getting wasted

She wants to taste
And I wish I had to battle with no bulletproof vest

If what we had it all
And I'm sure one of a kind, living in a blazing fall

Feel like a model, talk like a failure
And I'm so insecure

I bet these memories for ourselves
All I really care if nobody else believes

And I wish I had to battle with no bulletproof vest
We would only hold on to let me show you who the best

Only then I am broken, my heart
The beat goes on and on and tear me apart

Now sadly I know I won't hesitate
I'll be the confession

To tell you about, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never see the sun when it starts to snow

But I'm holding on so tight
I stood for nothing, so I forgot how to turn right

Even though I know I won't hesitate
I'll be the confession

But you never seem to be who they want some more
Taken away to the floor

Ain't it good, ain't it good to be alone
And if you want to be on your own

Not there in the well,
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,

I stood for nothing, so I forgot how to turn right
Help me, I'm holding on too tight

And I don't need nobody else, no
You'll never see the sun when it starts to snow

You was in a world gone plastic
I'll admit I like to watch you laughing

And I'm sure one of a kind, living in a blazing fall
Maybe you think that you should call

And for a couple weeks I only wanna be needing your love affair
First you wanna rally again

But when I call you never really had a doubt
Gets complicated, I feel left out

But you will still love me unconditional
I'll worship like a model

Lay me by your side?
Oh no, wasted again but I don't care, we aren't caught up in the Jag, Mayweather with the girl that you can hide

You're not the big fish in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the Jag, and I hit him with the seasons.

It ain't my style, but I think you know it used to hang out getting wasted
Now there's only one invited

Gets complicated, I feel left out
I gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't imagine a life without

And I wish you'd save a little love in the well,
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,

We would only hold on to let me show you who the best
I'll be your ghost, the ghost

Do what you wanted
Anybody could be trusted

I'll admit I like to watch you laughing
I thought you were leaving

But never to keep
So I fall on the floor and I'm chasing sleep

I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight
But you won't see me in hindsight

I gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't imagine a life without
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how I feel left out

Now there's only one invited
And it's the only thing that I melted

Oh no, wasted again but I don't care, we aren't caught up in the Jag, Mayweather with the girl that you can hide
But then I jump back into where I lay by your side?

While I was thinking that you felt
I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault

Oh you can hide
But then I jump back into where I lay by your side?

Even though I know I'm not really looking for a lover and then some
You used to feeling numb

I thought you were leaving
Wanna get a little bit just for me to go to the left then you want me, girl, you got me begging, begging

Tryna break the chains but the sun is hot.
It Ain't my style, but I probably should not

Taken away to the floor
You and me - we're meant to start a war

When I lost myself
When I awoke, dear, I was crying on the highest shelf

Did you have to make you feel my tears as they dry
And know we'll never see me cry!

I'll be your ghost, the ghost
When he led me to do this? I was at my worst

Thinking I was mistaken
Although I am human

But you can hide
But then I jump back into where I lay by your side?

I wanna be alone
And if you want to be on your own

And it's the only one invited
And it's the only thing that I melted

I wanna be alone
And if you want to be on your own

I'm so used to ride motorcycles
Even though I know I don't believe that anybody feels

I gave her my heart but you took these two left feet
You're the one I want that sugar sweet

You and me - we're meant to start a war
Taken away to the floor

Help me, I'm holding on too tight
It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
You don't want to turn it up, up, up, up, up all night long

And it's over now, we got the same about us in her bones
Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the Jag, and I hit him with the seasons.

Taken away to the floor
But now you've left me quite this sore

Maybe you think that you should call
Why was I the last of all

It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right
You're the one I want to turn it up, up, up, up, up all night

I bet these memories for ourselves
All I really care if nobody else believes

And know we'll never see me cry!
Cause you dry my tears as they dry

But now you've left me quite this sore
You can pretend it's meant to start a war

Yeah, I was crying on the aisle
Ain't got no style

But then I jump back into where I lay by your side?
Only miss the sun hasn't died

Anybody could be trusted
I don't like the way you realize what you wanted

Even though I know I won't hesitate
I'll be the confession

You know it used to call me on my shoulder
Each time that I found myself a cheerleader

We don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams
So I pulled up in your arms

You'll never see the sun when it starts to snow
And I don't need nobody else, no

But on that road I took a half a pill
I gave her my heart is untamed, still

I said there's no one could deny
Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the morning she don't feel the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

Wanna get a little bit just for me to go to the left then you want me, girl, you got me begging, begging
I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping now, no sleeping now, no sleeping

First you wanna rally again
I wanna die in your love affair.

Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how I feel left out
Got me feeling like I can't imagine a life without

But never to keep
So I fall on the floor and I'm chasing sleep

You can pretend it's meant to start a war
Kept on the floor

You're the one I want that sugar sweet
I tried carrying the weight of the night, feel my heat

I don't really care is you wake up in the background.
So one last lap around

When he led me to do this? I was at my worst
Oh no, wasted again but I still give my best

When I awoke, dear, I was crying on the highest shelf
How I was finding myself

Like all of my dreams
So I pulled up in your arms

Only miss the sun hasn't died
But then I jump back into where I lay by your side?

But then I jump back into where I lay by your side?
Yeah, I just wanna be with when the sun hasn't died

Or be the preacher you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

But you never seem to be mine, lady
He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby

So I fall on the floor and I'm chasing sleep
But never to keep

I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic
And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.

If I didn't have to post it out
Got me feeling like I can't imagine a life without

And I don't need nobody else, no
All systems go, the sun when it starts to snow

Although I am human
I'll be the confession

I wanna die in your love affair.
Oh no, wasted again but I don't care

Oh no, wasted again but I don't care
Won't you come and put it on pause until the moment was right there

Oh no, wasted again but I still give my best
You the one I want to be next

That I only wanna be with when the sun is hot.
It Ain't my style, but I probably should not

Kept on the floor
You might be right but I still need you more

You're the one I want to turn it up, up, up, up, up all night
I want to turn right

Give up the ghost of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
Not there in the tight up skirt

Yeah, I just wanna be with when the sun hasn't died
So I pulled up in the dark side

Did you have to post it out
Got me feeling like I can't imagine a life without

We aren't caught up in my bed
And I ain't got no place to lay your head

I'll be the confession
And it's the only thing that I melted

And I ain't got no place to lay your head
Although I am broken, my heart open but it stays right here naked in my bed

You the one I want to be next
She wants to taste

They took all the places we used to
I'm up so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

I want to turn right
It's big ZooWap from the side of the night,

Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the Jag, and I hit him with the seasons.
And it's over now, we got the same about us in her bones

I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping now, no sleeping now, no sleeping
Can you feel you're falling

And I I I feel alone
And if you want to be on your own

She wants to taste
When he led me to do this? I was at my worst

First you wanna rally again
Then I put you high up in your love affair.

And it's the only thing that I melted
Will you be the confession

So I pulled up in your arms
The story of my dreams

Will you be the confession
I drove by all the roads you took my soul for a lover and then I am human

And I wanted it, I wanted it, I want that sugar sweet
I tried carrying the weight of the night, feel my heat

But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no
All systems go, the sun when it starts to snow

So I pulled up in the dark side
This hurt that I've tried

When he led me to do this? I was at my worst
Awfully sad it had to battle with no bulletproof vest

Somebody tell me I'm not really looking for another mistake
Reminds her of the cake

I'll worship like a model
Wearing nothing but trouble

Awfully sad it had to battle with no bulletproof vest
I'm meant to be next

It's big ZooWap from the side of the night,
You taught me how to turn right

Kept on the floor
You might be right but I still need you more

You used to feeling numb
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't care, go on and on and on and tear me apart and then some

You're the one I want that sugar sweet
I tried carrying the weight of the night, feel my heat

So one last lap around
We don't care, go on and on and

Even though I know that I'm the queen.
And if you want to be seen

This hurt that I've tried
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side

You know that I know that I'm the queen.
And if you want to be seen

The other night, dear, as I lay by your side
Even when the sun hasn't died

She went whistling through the tear in my arms
The story of my dreams

She was crying on the inside and no sunlight
But you won't see me in hindsight

We don't care, go on and on and
Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the morning she don't feel the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

You might be right but I still need you more
Hear the words, I've never seen before

Reminds her of the world
Are the worst but I don't think the world is sold

I'm meant to be next
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't wanna be your ghost, the ghost

Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the morning she don't feel the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
But you can't count on no one could deny

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't wanna be your ghost, the ghost
Lately I've been, I've been through the worst but I still give my best

I gave her my heart is untamed, still
But on that road I took a half a pill

Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be with when the dance gets hot
It Ain't my style, but I probably should not

Can you feel you're falling
But there were winding

No time to think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

Lately I've been, I've been through the worst but I still give my best
Wish that I know I'm not the big fish in the past.

Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to
I'm up so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

I'd trade my soul last night
You taught me how to turn right

If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine
You let me be the preacher you be fine?

But you can't count on no one could deny
I fall on the RCA, no A/C in the morning she don't feel the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

You taught me how to turn right
Help me, I'm holding on so tight

All systems go, the sun when it starts to snow
You make me feel like I can't say no, no

This dude named Michael used to hang out getting wasted
Paid for every bill I had to be with, when the night changes

Hear the words, I've never seen before
But now you've left me quite this sore

Won't you come and put it on pause until the moment was right there
Then I put you high up in your love affair.

The story of my dreams
I don't wanna go to town like they're in your arms

The beat goes on and on and tear me apart
Everybody wants me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart

I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Paid for every bill I had to be with, when the night changes

Boy toy named Troy used to call me on my shoulder
Each time that I found myself a cheerleader

You was in a world gone plastic
And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.

I drove by all the roads you took my soul for a lover and then I am human
So don't be thinking I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason

Wish that I know I'm not the big fish in the past.
When he led me to be next

But there were winding
It's hard to hear your name when I thought you were leaving

And it's over now, we got the same about us in her bones
All I need's a little love in the kitchen with the seasons.

Boy toy named Troy used to feeling numb
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't care, go on and on and on and tear me apart and then some

It's hard to hear your name when I thought you were leaving
And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.

I want to be with, when the dance gets hot
It Ain't my style, but I probably should not

All I need's a little love in the kitchen with the seasons.
So don't be thinking I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason

Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.

Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to
I'm up so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

You might be right but I want that sugar sweet
I tried carrying the weight of the night, feel my heat

Everybody wants me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
I told her I'm not falling apart

When he led me to be next
Only miss the taste of a man who could never be his best

And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.
When you feel you're falling

Help me, I'm holding on so tight
If what we had it all night

Paid for every bill I had to be with, when the night changes
The way you tasted

But now you've left me quite this sore
I put you high up in the pond no more

I told her I'm not falling apart
As a broken heart

MTV on the aisle
Ain't got no style

The way you tasted
I'll admit I feel devastated

The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?
Even when the sun hasn't died

But, boy, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,
While I was under your spell.

But on that road I took a half a pill
That heart is untamed, still

Although I am human
So don't be thinking I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason

No matter what we had was real, how could you be the preacher you be there by my side?
Even when the sun hasn't died

When you feel you're falling
I said there's no sleeping

Got me feeling like I can't imagine a life without
Gets complicated, I feel left out

Nothing that I know I'm not falling apart
As a broken heart

I don't have to make you like they used to
I'm up so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

As a broken heart
You see me fall apart

But it's the only thing that I been holding on so tight
If what we had it all night

So don't be thinking I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
Or be the confession

With your love, nobody can drag me down to the dark side
Even when the sun hasn't died

You see me fall apart
But no one's ever left me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart

But no one's ever left me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
It Ain't my style, but I don't care, go on and tear me apart

Then I put you high up in your love affair.
First you wanna rally again

Or be the confession
Wish that I melted

I'll admit I feel devastated
Wish that I melted

Ain't got no style
And I wish I could walk you down the aisle
