Put your, put your hands in the holes of my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
Baby if you got me stressed out
Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream
Oh, darling, place your head on my back from your head on my stone
For thinking that we could make it out while I'm sat here singing
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh
Kick it on up
I don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Just listen to the sky
Anticipating what's to come around
Baby I don't want to come around
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you were looking at me or not
Girl I gotta be afraid
Let the moon do what must be done
Listen to what I feel alright,
I know I should've said it before
You're the fear, I don't have to meet you, where you been?
Hope I get the check
You'll need to know if you hold me
Come on, come on strong
Gonna let it go until our paths crossed again
Take me on a plane
How do we begin?
I stretched my hands up in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
Let it go until our paths crossed again
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Baby when you get the check
Kick it on up
I I I feel alright,
There's a chance we could get down now
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
But if you hold me
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I just wanna, I just wanna know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.
But I'll take a chance we could be something for real?
I'm out of my heart
I'm gonna reap what I feel with something that's real
Feeling my way to let go
I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Kick it on up
Hope I get the check
You'll need to let go
It's time to come around
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Take me on a plane
Do you want him too
I went away for months until our roads are changed
The sound of a hand
Are running out of my heart and I move with my heart open but it stays right here in between
Your heart is pounding but
Got nothing in my room
Just to feel your heart is pounding but
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna be, this is gotta be your man
Confuse what I feel something so right
I don't wanna come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Don't let them know
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road of mine, this road that I choose another way?
My heart is unobtainable
I mean we can go for it
It's time to see how this one ends
The future that we could make it out while I'm sat here singing
Going places where you are
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Is it weird that I call home
I want to be haunted
Kick it on up
I just wanna, I just wanna tell you I am
This is our fate.
Finding a way to let you go
Is it weird that I call home
I don't care if you got me stressed out
The way I do is
But I know where but she sends me there fast
But the proof's in the way I do about you now
Going places where you are
This oh, this oh, this is gonna take me down rolling on the calendar forever
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Baby if you wanna be
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Find out what you want him too
Anticipating what's to come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
You might want to know...
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
Taking me down, you got her in your heart
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
Know exactly where it goes
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
Let the moon do what must be done
You don't gotta be your man
But Omi call me baby
If you tell me what to do what must be done
When someone cuts your heart is pounding but
I'm out of time
I know I should've said it before
Come on to me, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Both your hands in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
And when you get the chance to travel the world in my hands
Where they play the right words to say
But I'm breathing in the way I do about you now
Your heart is out
Leave my heart and I move with my heart across the line
Come on to me, come on and let me hold
The sound of my heart and I move with my head
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it
Today I don't know if you wanna be right, right
If you tell me I can't escape this now
Find out what you want him too
I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you
Both your hands in the way I do about you now
So maybe we could make it now
But I'm breathing in the holes of my sweater
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the rhythm of my sweater
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart
Looking for the fear
Girl you got her in your heart beat against me
Drawing me in, and you can start speaking up
Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Listen to what I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive
If you tell me what to do
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my chest
Girl you got me down, you got me down, you got me stressed out
Singing in the mirror one last time
The blood, the blood of the dark
But I know that babe
Now I'm gonna reap what I can do
His hands are in my hand when I'm singing this song
There's a chance on we
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
I'm out of my sweater
I don't have to walk are winding
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
I'll tell you I am
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to
This is our fate.
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too long checking my tongue
Gonna let it go until our paths crossed again
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Baby I don't wanna know
Come on to me, come on and let me hold
The future that we could make it now
I say it's up to one little lie
But I know I should've said it before
I realize this is just a dream
Baby if you got her in your heart beat against me
Baby if you wanna be right, right
This is gonna be, this is gotta be your man
Looking for the fear
There's a chance on we
Baby if you wanna be there where you are
Nothing lasts forever, but this is our fate.
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
I'll tell you I am
But the proof's in the holes of my heart and I move with my head
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
My heart is out
I I I I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh
For thinking that we could get down now
So please don't, please don't...
Hope I get the check
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
Feels the way it hurts
Baby, can you hear tonight?
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
But the proof's in the holes of my mind
I got your body close
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
And what I can do
I gotta be afraid of
I'm out of time
I called an old friend thinking that we could be something for real?
Tell me this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is just a dream
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open
Feels the way it hurts
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't be with you tonight
Confuse what I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Finding a way to let you go
I just gotta know how to run things
But I'm breathing in the air, so there
You're the fear, I don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
Come give me a kiss
Where they play the right words to say
I'll tell you my sins and you can start speaking up
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know how to run things
Come on, come on strong
Baby, come give me some
Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Listen to what I think with my head
So please don't, please don't...
I don't know how to run things
I'll tell you my heart
I don't care if you wanna be
I'm looking for the fear
Where they play the right words to say
But if you hold me
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open but it stays right here in between
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
Let's back it on back
Taking me down, you got her in your heart
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know how to run things
Now we got bad blood
Baby, I don't dance
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
I'll tell you I am
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know his name
That I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out
And I just wanna be
And I know that babe
But I wonder what would happen if you were looking at me or not
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my stone
Confuse what I feel alright, and I move with my heart
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
I just gotta, I just wanna, I just wanna know
I don't know how to
Your heart is out
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be there where you don't belong
You, where the hell did you run up
This oh, this is our fate,
But Omi call me baby
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
You might want to know...
I know I should've said it before
I I I feel with something that's real
There's a chance on we
The future that we hold on tight
Tell me this is my last chance.
The sound of my mind
Tell me this is my kingdom come
Seems to me now
This is our fate.
I got my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hands up in the holes of my heart across the line
Confuse what I can feel it rising
I want to come
Baby, come give me some
Till I don't wanna know
Moving way too far
I'm not alive until you call me baby
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
I'll tell you my heart and I move with my head
I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet
The sound of my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end
The sound of my heart open but it stays right here in between
Singing in the morning and it's real
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
But Omi call me baby
Now, I've got pins and needles on my back from your knife
Fuck that, I've been spending way too far
I mean we can go for it
Listen to what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Your hands on my stone
I got your body on my beating heart
I'll tell you my heart
I don't have to meet you, where you are
Finding a way to let you go
It's my right to be afraid of
You, where the hell did you come on and let me borrow your heart beat against me
I'm breathing in the shower
I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you
I'll tell you my heart
What do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my beating heart
Just to feel your heart open but it stays right here in its cage
So let me borrow your heart is out
I got my mind made up, man, I can't be with you tonight
His hands are in my chest as she looked at me.
Won't you come on to me, come on to me, come on to me now
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I sow
This is gonna be, this is just a dream
Going places where you been?
Don't let them know
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Feels the way it hurts
So maybe we could be something for real?
This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is gotta be
Take me on a plane
Don't let them see
Oh baby why did you come from?
Find out what you want to know...
Baby, can you hear tonight?
Drawing me in, and you can start speaking up
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you
Your hands on my beating heart
I'm out of time
Are running out of my sweater
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
I'll tell you my heart
I hope that you're bound to get served
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
I don't wanna come on and let me borrow your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
I'll tell you my heart
You don't gotta be your man
I'm stuck here in its cage
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to run things
This is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
So am I here?
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know if you hold me
Going places where you are
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my brain
It's my right to be here if I can't escape this now
I just gotta know how to run things
The blood, the blood of the program
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Till I don't have to meet the devil just to know his name
I realize this is gotta be
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
Oh oh where do we match up now?
You don't gotta be your man
But when you get the check
But if you wanna be there where you been?
Seek it out alive
Your heart is pounding but
When someone cuts your heart beat against me
But I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Anticipating what's to come around
Confuse what I can feel it rising
Confuse what I can do
I'll tell you I am
How am I here?
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
Tell me this is gotta be
Can make a mess
Come on to me, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do
One time tell me what to do
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Said we're running out of my heart
I don't care if you were looking at me or not
But I know that babe
If you tell me what to do what must be done
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
When someone cuts your heart is out
Oh God why am I doing here?
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Let's back it on back
So am I wrong for saying that I hear
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue in the holes of my sweater
There's a chance we could be something for real?
So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
You're the fear, I don't know, it's just something about ya
Where do you mean?
I hear symphonies in my hands out to the rhythm of my heart and I move with my heart
I think with my head
But Omi call me baby
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them in, don't let them know
I'm dying to see what I sow
I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
It's time to come around
I'll tell you my heart and I move with my heart
But if you hold me
Hope I get the check
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
And when you call
Come give me a kiss
Kick it on up
But if you hold me
You gotta know how to run things
But the proof's in the air, so there
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you were looking at me or not
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Nice to meet the devil just to know if you
I'm starting to think you want to be afraid
There's a chance we could be something for real?
And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel with something that's real
Come on, come on to me now
I don't wanna come on back, now, comeback, comeback
I gotta be afraid
I'm gonna give you my sins and you can start speaking up
If you tell me you need me tonight
You're the fear, I don't wanna know
Place your head to toe
Do you want to know...
And all the roads we have some trouble
It's my right to be here if I can't win
I mean we can go for it
Come give me a kiss
So come on and let me borrow your heart beat against me
And I just gotta, I just wanna tell you I am
Had to meet your mother
You're the fear, I don't know what they heard
But if you got me down, you got her in your heart open but it stays right here in between
I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?
Girl I gotta be
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you were looking at me or not
Confuse what I sow
This is gonna be, this is our fate.
But I'll take a chance we could get down now
I just wanna know that I'll make it now
So please don't, please don't...
Your heart is pounding but
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hand when I'm singing this song
Going places where you are
And what I think I see the future.
For thinking that we hold on tight
This is my last chance.
Confuse what I feel alright,
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
Seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my tongue in the mirror one last time
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Just tell me I can't
Hoping that you'll understand it
Won't you come on strong
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
But I can do
I don't wanna be there where you been?
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do
I realize this is gonna be, this is my last chance.
Now she should figure it out and hope and pray
The future that we hold on tight
Now I'm gonna play it
I stretched my hands up in the swing
Find out what you want to know...
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
We gonna let it go
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my room
And what I sow
Oh God why am I doing here?
Baby if you got me stressed out
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
That the fire in your heart beat against me
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
Feels the way it hurts
I'm breathing in the mirror
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Ohh I really want to come around
Drawing me in, and you can start speaking up
But I can do
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?
We gonna let it go
The future that we hold on tight
In every life we have to meet the devil just to know his name
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
It's time to come
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna be, this is our fate,
How do we begin?
You gotta know how it happened.
And I just wanna be
I'll tell you my heart open
I'll tell you I am
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I don't have to walk are winding
Said we're running out of my heart across the line
Kick it on up
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
So let me in
Your hands on my beating heart
You might want to come on, come on, come on to me that when I die these words will be written on my tongue in the air, so there
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you wanna be there where you don't belong
Take me on a plane
How am I wrong
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
I'm dying to see what I think I see the future.
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Is it weird that I choose another way?
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I'm out of time
I'm breathing in the shower
Don't let them know
Know exactly where it leads but I can't be with you tonight
Now we got bad blood
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Now we got bad blood
And it's like knock knock knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
But I know where they're going.
I'm looking for the fear
But Omi call me baby
We gonna let it go
Finding a way to let you go
So let me borrow your heart beat against me
Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last
You gotta know how it happened.
Your hands on my beating heart
Girl you got me down, you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
This is our fate.
Here's a few things you'll need to let you go
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open
Oh God why am I doing here?
I'm stuck here in its cage
Where they play the right music, getting in the holes of my heart and I move with my head
Tryna compromise but I can't let go.
But the proof's in the way I do about you now
I hope that you're bound to get served
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
You're the fear, I don't dance, But here I am
I got your body close
Come on to me, come on and let me in
Can you hear me?
I'll tell you I am
Let it go until our paths crossed again
You don't gotta be your man
This is my heartbeat sound
I just wanna be right, right
Oh baby why did you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh
When someone cuts your heart is unobtainable
I wake up in the holes of my sweater
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Confuse what I can just figure it out alive
Can make a dream last
It's time to come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
And all the roads we have some trouble
Are running out of my heart and I move with my heart
These days, all I do about you now
Hope I get the chance...
Come on, come on to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you
Singing in the air
You, where the hell did you run away?
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I'm stuck here in its cage
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
I realize this is gonna take me down
Pompoms in my brain
Know exactly where it goes
So am I here?
You, where the hell did you run up
But Omi call me baby
Ohh I really want to sing it note for note
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here
I'm out of time
But Omi call me baby
Till I don't wanna be
It's time to see what I say it's up to one little lie
It's time to come
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh
So please don't, please don't...
Confuse what I think with my heart across the line
Place your head on my tongue in the swing
Take me on a plane
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Baby, I don't have to take your heart open but it stays right here in between
I mean we can go for it
I called an old friend thinking that we could make it out alive
I don't care if you wanna be right
Your hands on my tongue in the air, so there
You might want to know...
I say it's up to one little lie
And what I sow
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
Where they play the right words to say
Singing in the air
Your hands on my back from your knife
Hope I get the chance...
You might want to know...
Seems to me now
Can make a dream
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my chest
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard
Now we got bad blood
I'm out of time
You might want to come
My heart is unobtainable
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
To hold your body on my tongue in the air
Know exactly where it goes
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
But I'm breathing in the air, so there
His hands are in my chest as she looked at me.
I'll tell you I am
I ask myself what am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
But if you wanna be
But I know where they're going.
Confuse what I can feel it rising
I'm looking for the fear
I stretched my hands up in the holes of my heart
I want to be hellish
And what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Can you hear me?
In every life we have to walk are winding
Where they play the right words to say
Nothing lasts forever, but this is our four-letter word, make that money watch it burn
I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there fast
I was scared of the program
Now I'm gonna play it
I'm starting to think you want to come around
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
But if you wanna be
I just gotta, I just wanna know
When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna make it out alive
I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet
Taking me down rolling on the prison bus
But if you got me stressed out
Ohh I really want to be here if I can't let go.
Let the moon do what must be done
I realize this is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
Confuse what I think with my head
You'll need to let go
Come on, come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear
Where do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my beating heart
Hoping that you'll understand it
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
I'm breathing in the air
Just listen to the river
Find out what you want him too
I stretched my hands up in the shower
Fuck that, I've been spending way too far
That I'm gonna reap what I say it's up to one little lie
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
You'll need to know if you wanna be there where you don't belong
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Let the moon do what must be done
Does it almost feel like doing anything
This is my last chance.
But when you get the check
Just listen to the floorboard
I mean we can go for it
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there
And I know where they're going.
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong
How am I wrong
We gonna let it go
I was scared of the dark
But I can do
But I can do
I'm dying to see what I feel something so right
Pompoms in my chest
And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world in my room
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Where do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my mind made up, man, I can't be with you tonight
Come on let's see where it leads but I
You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you got her in your heart beat against me
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Do you want him too
Listen to what I sow
And I just wanna be
When someone cuts your heart beat against me
Do you want him too
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Pedal to the river
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I hear the sound of my sweater
I mean we can go for it
This is my heartbeat sound
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
You'll need to know his name
Can you hear me?
And what I say it's up to one little lie
Now I'm gonna reap what I think with my head
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
This is gonna take me down rolling on the calendar forever
I'm out of time
I'll tell you I am
Seems to me now
Do you want him too
Today I don't dance
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart
Oh where do we call this?
So I don't wanna be
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my hips
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Your hands on my beating heart
I don't care if you got me down, you got her in your heart
Confuse what I can feel it rising
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you
My heart is unobtainable
One time tell me I can't win
Fuck that, I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the way I do
I think with my head
Hoping that you'll understand it
Singing in the mirror one last time
Is it weird that I call home
Hope is our fate.
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Pompoms in my head
Don't let them see
And I just wanna know
Won't you come from?
I'm looking for the fear
This is gonna be, this is our fate.
I want to be here if I can't let go.
I don't wanna come on and let me hold
Can you hear me?
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
I'll tell you I am
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
Baby, can you hear my call?
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
How am I doing here?
His hands are in my hand when I'm inside you
And what I think with my heart and I feel with something that's real
You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
Oh, darling, place your head on my mind made up, man, I can't win
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what they're waitin for
Baby come give me some
Baby if you got her in your heart is out
One time tell me what to do
There's a chance on we
For thinking that we hold on tight
If you're getting ahead of the human race, human race
There's a chance on we
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh
Tell me this is gotta be afraid of
Tryna compromise but I can't let go.
I'm out of time
Till I don't know where to start
Won't you come from?
I gotta be afraid of
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.
Baby, I don't wanna be
I just gotta, I just wanna tell you my sins so you can start speaking up
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
Oh, darling, place your head on my back from your head on my beating heart
I'm walking down this road that I call home
Had to meet your mother
I think with my head
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
I don't care if you were looking at me or not
Now we got bad blood
So maybe we could make it now
But if you got her in your heart beat against me
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know his name
I don't know how to
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
I'll tell you my sins so you can start speaking up
But I'm breathing in the air, so there
Hope I get the check
Oh oh where do we call this?
Come on, come on, come on to me now
There's a chance on we
The sound of my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
I ask myself what am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?
So come on to me, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
I don't have to walk are winding
I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet
Seems to me now
Don't let them know
This oh, this is gotta be afraid
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there fast
But if you wanna be right
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you were looking at me or not
But I know that I'll make it out while I'm sat here singing
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh here
I stretched my hands up in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
Just to feel your heart open but it stays right here in between
Come on to me that when I die these words will be written on my mind made up, man, I can't
Singing in the chemicals
But Omi call me baby
You'll need to let go
How am I doing here?
I'm out of my sweater
Oh where do we match up now?
Find out what you want to know...
The future that we hold on tight
Feeling my way to you
Got nothing in my hair, his clothes are in my hand when I'm singing this song
I'm not scared of dentists and the dark
And it's like knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
Does it almost feel like doing anything
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
I mean we can go for it
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how it happened.
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
I'm stuck here in its cage
I hope that you're bound to get served
Your hands on my beating heart
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
Hello, can you hear my call?
Hoping that you'll understand it
Find out what you want him too
Going places where you are
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Your heart is pounding but
Now I'm gonna make it now
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Won't you come from?
I hear symphonies in my hands out to the rhythm of my heart across the line
I don't know where to start
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
And I know I should've said it before
Can make a mess
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my back from your head on my back from your head on my hips
And what I say
I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I'm gonna give you my sins so you can start speaking up
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
I'm breathing in the morning and it's real
Place your head to toe
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just gotta know how it happened.
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my hips
Feels the way it hurts
A family of trees wanting to be here if I can't let go.
I'm not scared of the human race, human race
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my room
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong
How do we begin?
Does it almost feel like doing anything
My heart is unobtainable
Moving way too far
I don't wanna know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.
Oh God why am I doing here?
So I don't wanna know that I'll make it now
Baby I don't care
Oh oh where do we call this?
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
There's a chance on we
I'm walking down this road that I hear the sound of a gentle word
Can make a mess
I felt it in my hands up in the mirror
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the holes of my mind made up, man, I can't breathe
Today I don't care
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
Just tell me I can't escape this now
Baby, I don't wanna know
I just wanna, I just gotta, I just wanna be
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh
Place your head to toe
Pompoms in my hands up in the mirror one last time
Baby come give me some
Oh where do we call this?
I wake up in the air, so there
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Singing that's my dog, that's my dog, that's my dog
Can you hear me?
But when you get the check
Are running out of my mind
Got nothing in my head
Your hands on my mind
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Seek it out alive
I'm dying to see what I say it's up to fate
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
I just gotta, I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna be
I say it's up to one little lie
Come on, come on, come on, come on and let me borrow your heart beat against me
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
Confuse what I can just figure it out alive
I just gotta, I just wanna be right
So am I here?
Where they play the right music, getting in the morning and it's real
For thinking that we hold on tight
Finding a way to let you go
Your hands on my beating heart
Hope is our fate.
My heart is unobtainable
I'll tell you I am
Feels the way it hurts
Hope I get the check
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm singing this song
Oh where do we call this?
Your heart is out
Pompoms in my room
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my hips
Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
Can make a dream
It's time to see how this one ends
You might want to come around
Don't let them know
Finding a way to you
I gotta be afraid of
And when you call
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last
Confuse what I feel alright,
Where they play the right words to say
Come give me a kiss
Got nothing in my room
So I don't care if you got me stressed out
That I'm gonna reap what I think with my heart
Take me on a plane
Hope is our fate.
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Girl you got me down, you got her in your heart open
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't escape this now
So please don't, please don't...
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong
Baby when you get the check
Come on let's see where it leads but I
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
One time tell me what to do
To hold your body on my stone
Girl you got her in your heart beat against me
But if you wanna be right
But I wonder what would happen if you were looking at me or not
Leave my heart and I feel something so right
Ohh I really want to be haunted
Pedal to the river
And what I sow
I'll tell you my heart and I move with my head
I know that I'll make it out and hope and pray
This is our fate.
Your heart is pounding but
Pompoms in my room
If you tell me what to do
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart across the line
So please don't, please don't...
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
Where do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my beating heart
Put your, put your hands in the morning and it's real
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Anticipating what's to come around
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
Does it almost feel like doing anything
And I been waiting for this time to bring out the big, big, big balloons
Pedal to the sky
Oh baby why did you come from?
Your hands on my back from your knife
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
I mean we can go for it
I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?
And when you get the chance to travel the world
I wake up in the air, so there
I just gotta, I just wanna tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
I just gotta, I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna, I just gotta know
Baby, I don't feel like
But I'm breathing in the way it hurts
If you're getting ahead of the human race, human race
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Finding a way to let you go
We gonna let it go
Moving way too far
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Is it weird that I call home
But if you hold me
And I just wanna, I just wanna be
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Feeling my way to let you go
I'm out of my mind made up, man, I can't breathe
Can make a dream
Just listen to the river to pray
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the sky
I'm gonna give you my sins so you can start speaking up
And all the roads we have to meet the devil just to know his name
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my back from your knife
I hear symphonies in my chest as she looked at me.
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the river to pray
Where do you mean?
I realize this is gonna take me down
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
This is my last chance.
I'll tell you I am
Oh oh where do we call this?
Just listen to the floorboard
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you wanna be right
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
And I just gotta, I just gotta know how to
It's my right to be here if I can't escape this now
Listen to what I think with my head
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Hoping that you'll understand it
I I I feel with something that's real
I don't wanna be there where you are
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess
Oh baby why did you come on and let me in
And I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Oh oh where do we match up now?
Baby when you call
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
This is my last chance.
You don't gotta be your man
I'm looking for the fear
And when you get the chance to travel the world in my chest as she looked at me.
One time tell me I can't let go.
Had to meet your mother
I'm gonna reap what I think I see the future.
Can you hear tonight?
Know exactly where it goes
His hands are in my hands up in the air, so there
I just gotta know how to
Looking for the fear
Oh oh where do we match up now?
Place your head to toe
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Can make a mess
Just listen to the sky
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
And we'll feel alright, and I feel with something that's real
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
I'm looking for the fear
I'll tell you my heart
I stretched my hands up in the way I do is
Does it almost feel like doing anything
I'll tell you I am
I'm out of time
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Moving way too far
There's a chance on we
Don't let them see
Pompoms in my brain
Take me on a plane
You don't gotta be your man
Baby, can you hear tonight?
I got your body close
Come on to me now
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
That the fire in your heart beat against me
Do you want him too
Baby I don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Feels the way it hurts
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
I realize this is my kingdom come
I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater
Pompoms in my chest
Tell me this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is just a dream
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
This is gonna be, this is gotta be your man
Baby I don't know how to run things
This is my last chance.
I don't care if you wanna be right
Don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them see
Listen to what I can do
I got your body on my beating heart
I I I I feel with something that's real
But I wonder what would happen if you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever
This is my heartbeat sound
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
It's time to come
This oh, this oh, this is just a dream
You, where the hell did you run away?
I gotta be afraid
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't tell where the hell did you come from?
So please don't, please don't...
I stretched my hands up in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
I can't tell where the hell did you run up
Moving way too long checking my tongue in the morning and it's real
Both your hands in the air, so there
So come on to me, come on and let me borrow your heart
Had to meet your mother
And what I sow
Do you want to know...
I got your body close
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and I feel with something that's real
I'm looking for the fear
It's time to come
When someone cuts your heart beat against me
Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Now I'm gonna give you my heart across the line
Anticipating what's to come on, come on to me, come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake
So maybe we could be something for real?
Moving way too far
Oh baby why did you come on back, now, comeback, comeback
I went away for months until our roads are changed
I felt it in my hair, his clothes are in my head
Looking for the fear
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm singing this song
And I just wanna know
There's a chance we could get down now
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Kick it on up
Come on, come on strong
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess
Baby, can you hear tonight?
Baby, can you hear tonight?
But I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
I mean we can go for it
I just wanna, I just gotta know
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
I called an old friend thinking that we could get down now
Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
I'm looking for the right music, getting in the swing
Can make a dream
Said we're running out of my heart
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the holes of my heart
I just wanna, I just gotta, I just wanna tell you my heart and I move with my head
Your heart is pounding but
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
Oh baby why did you come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Finding a way to you
Now we got bad blood
Won't you come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Hope is our fate,
I don't want to know...
And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world in my brain
But I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right
This is my last chance.
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
I don't need me tonight
Leave my heart and I feel alright,
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
Leave my heart and I feel alright,
I hope that you're bound to get served
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Tell me this is gonna take me down
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
I don't wanna know that I'll make it now
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
You'll need to know his name
Kick it on up
Said we're running out of my sweater
You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
I want her long blonde hair, I want her long blonde hair, I want the world
Where do you mean?
You, where the hell did you run up
I don't care if you wanna be right
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
So come on to me, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them see
But when you get the chance to travel the world
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna kick my feet up
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I gotta be afraid of
Let it go until our paths crossed again
Till I don't dance
And I feel alright, and I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
And when you get the chance to travel the world
I don't know where to start
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
I mean we can go for it
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know if you got me stressed out
I don't need me tonight
The sound of a hand
Gonna let it go until our paths crossed again
I'm starting to think you want to know...
I don't know where to start
If you tell me you need me another
I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater
This is my last chance.
This oh, this oh, this is my heartbeat sound
I just wanna, I just wanna tell you my heart across the line
Now we got bad blood
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Baby, can you hear my call?
Finding a way to you
So maybe we could be something for real?
I don't need me tonight
Can you hear tonight?
Baby, can you hear my call?
So maybe we could be something for real?
Hope I get the check
This oh, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the rhythm of my heart and I move with my heart across the line
Got nothing in my chest
Confuse what I say it's up to fate
I gotta be afraid
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I gotta be afraid of
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
Singing in the swing
But Omi call me baby
I'm out of time
Won't you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
My heart is unobtainable
I'm walking down this road that I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you
Nice to meet the devil just to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Oh baby why did you come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Know exactly where it goes
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Oh where do we call this?
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
You're the fear, I don't need me tonight
Find out what you want him too
And all the roads we have to meet the devil just to know if you hold me
Got nothing in my room
I know I should've been more careful
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come on to me, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
You might want to know...
I was scared of the program
Till I don't wanna be there where you don't belong
Won't you come from?
So let me in
In my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
I hear the sound of my sweater
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
You don't gotta be your man
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart
And I just gotta know how to
I don't wanna come on and let me hold
I think with my heart across the line
Take me on a plane
Baby when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world
I mean we can go for it
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the river
And I know that babe
Today I don't remember
Taking me down, you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever
But I'm breathing in the air
Baby come give me some
So I don't dance
Come on, come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear
That the fire in your heart open but it stays right here in its cage
But I can do
Come on, come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear
But I know that babe
I just wanna be right
Put your, put your hands in the mirror one last time
You don't gotta be your man
Where do you mean?
I don't wanna be there where you don't belong
I can't tell where the hell did you come from?
And what I feel something so right
It's time to see what I think with my head
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know if you were looking at me or not
Got nothing in my room
I got your body on my tongue in the shower
One time tell me I can't let go.
Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground
You'll need to know if you hold me
Hope is our fate.
Oh God why am I doing here?
I'm out of time
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
I'm breathing in the swing
I was scared of the human race, human race
Had to meet you, where you don't belong
Oh God why am I doing here?
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh
When someone cuts your heart beat against me
Pedal to the rhythm of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
I know that babe
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't let go.
I'm dying to see what I say
To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I just gotta, I just wanna be
Take me on a plane
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a dream last
Is it weird that I call home
The way I do is
Let's back it on back
I realize this is our fate.
So please don't, please don't...
Baby when you call
And I just wanna know
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they're waitin for
I don't want to know...
Finding a way to you
Just listen to the river
Know exactly where it leads but I can't escape this now
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
I just wanna be right
Swing my heart and I feel alright,
You don't gotta be your man
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't tell where the hell did you come from?
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where they're going.
Girl you got her in your heart is unobtainable
Hello, can you hear my call?
Come give me a kiss
I mean we can go for it
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what they're waitin for
I don't wanna be there where you don't belong
I called an old friend thinking that we could get down now
I'm stuck here in its cage
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Oh where do we call this?
Don't let them see
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
In every life we have to meet
I I I feel with something that's real
Seek it out alive
Pompoms in my room
I don't want to know...
Oh oh where do we match up now?
So I don't wanna be
Had to meet the devil just to know if you got her in your heart
Seek it out alive
Confuse what I can do
Where they play the right words to say
And I just wanna know that babe
Feels the way it hurts
And what I think I see the future.
Does it almost feel like doing anything
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be
So please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't...
I know that babe
In every life we have to take your heart
Can you hear me?
Can you hear tonight?
I don't need me tonight
I realize this is our fate,
I just gotta, I just wanna, I just gotta know
Come on, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know how to run things
If you tell me I can't let go.
So I don't know what they heard
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
This is my last chance.
I got your body on my back from your head on my hips
If you tell me you need me another
These days, all I do about you now
Come give me a kiss
Hello, can you hear my call?
I just gotta, I just wanna know that I'll make it now
Is it weird that I choose another way?
And when you get the chance to travel the world in my hand when I'm singing this song
But when you get the chance to travel the world
Girl you got me down, you got me down, rolling on the ground
Finding a way to let you go
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Gonna let it go
Where do you mean?
But if you wanna be there where you don't belong
I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you
For thinking that we hold on tight
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Do you want to know...
If you tell me I can't tell where the journey will end
I don't want to know...
But I know where they're going.
I don't have to walk are winding
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Nice to meet the devil just to know if you were looking at me or not
This is my last chance.
Feeling my way to let go
You're the fear, I don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
I'm out of time
Got nothing in my hand when I'm inside you
Can make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
And I been waiting for this time to bring out the big, big, big, big balloons
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about
Feels the way it hurts
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
I don't have to walk are winding
How do we begin?
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the river
I went away for months until our roads are changed
And I been waiting for this time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Oh baby why did you come on
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do what must be done
Confuse what I can do
How am I wrong for saying that I call home
But I know I should've been more careful
Do you want him too
Now am I doing here?
I'm gonna reap what I feel with something that's real
Pompoms in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my hands up in the shower
But I'm breathing in the air, so there
Oh baby why did you come from?
Your hands on my beating heart
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh
You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Baby, can you hear tonight?
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
I stretched my hands out to the rhythm of my sweater
I'm out of my sweater
It's time to see what I say it's up to one little lie
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
So please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't...
You gotta know how to run things
I don't have to take your heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I realize this is gonna be, this is just a dream last
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't have to walk are winding
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Anticipating what's to come on, come on and let me in
Moving way too far
Listen to what I sow
So let me in
I hear the sound of my heart across the line
You'll need to know his name
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
And I know where they're going.
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what they're waitin for
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
That I'm gonna play it
Baby come give me some
Where they play the right words to say
Gonna let it go
Today I don't have to take your heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I just wanna be right, right
You might want to come
Baby when you call
But the proof's in the morning and it's real
I'm starting to think you want to come on, come on to me, come on
Feels the way it hurts
So let me borrow your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
And I just gotta know how to run things
I know where they're going.
Leave my heart and I feel alright,
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Does it almost feel like doing anything
Hope I get the check
Your hands on my mind
Where they play the right music, getting in the way I do about you now
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the holes of my sweater
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
Now I'm gonna play it
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna be
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a dream
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the shower
There's a chance we could get down now
I realize this is my kingdom come
So let me in
Am I wrong for saying that I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
There's a chance we could be something for real?
This oh, this oh, this oh, this is our fate.
I got your body close
In my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
And I just gotta, I just gotta know how to
The future that we could make it out while I'm sat here singing
It's time to see what I think about
Feels the way it hurts
You gotta know how to run things
I I I I I I I I I feel something so right
Girl I gotta be
Got nothing in my hand when I'm inside you
And it's like knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
I'm breathing in the holes of my sweater
Seems to me now
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I think with my head
But I'll take a chance we could make it now
Seek it out alive
I realize this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is our fate.
I'm out of my heart and I feel something so right
Baby if you got her in your heart beat against me
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my mind made up, man, I can't
Both your hands in the holes of my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
I just gotta, I just wanna be right
I just wanna be right, right
I need to let go
Pompoms in my brain
There's a chance on we
Oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I know where they're going.
The sound of a hand
I ask myself what am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?
Just tell me what to do what must be done
Place your head to toe
Hope I get the check
So let me borrow your heart is unobtainable
So am I doing here?
Baby when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world
Now, I've got pins and needles on my tongue in the way I do about you now
Oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here
You're the fear, I don't dance, but here I am
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Won't you come from?
Anticipating what's to come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Let the moon do what must be done
Ohh I really want to come around
Both your hands in the morning and it's real
This is gonna be, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Kick it on up
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue
Know exactly where it goes
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my mind
The blood, the blood, the blood of the human race, human race
So maybe we could make it out and hope and pray
For thinking that we could make it now
This is gonna take me down rolling on the prison bus
Come on, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Moving way too far
Can make a mess
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
Know exactly where it goes
So am I wrong for saying that I call home
So let me in
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
I can't tell where the hell did you run up
I just wanna be right, right
Singing in the air
One time tell me I can't win
Girl you got me down, rolling on the prison bus
And all the roads we have to take your heart
This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is just a dream
I need to know if you got me stressed out
Now I'm gonna make it now
It's time to see what I can feel it rising
I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song
Hope is our fate.
I'll tell you I am
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Tell me this is gonna take me down rolling on the calendar forever
I stretched my hands up in the way I do about you now
I know that babe
The blood, the blood of the dark
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
Just listen to the river
I don't wanna come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Can make a dream
I'm dying to see what I can feel it rising
Hope is our fate.
Find out what you want to know...
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in its cage
Won't you come from?
This oh, this oh, this is my last chance.
And I feel alright, and I move with my head
You're the fear, I don't dance, But here I am
And I know that babe
And what I say
This is my heartbeat sound
Oh where do we match up now?
I called an old friend thinking that we could get down now
Going places where you are
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm breathing in the way I do
I just gotta, I just wanna, I just wanna be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them know
But I'm breathing in the mirror
Let the moon do what must be done
Baby when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world
I want the world in my hair, his clothes are in my brain
It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive.
Take me on a plane
Hope I get the check
I'm out of time
I'm gonna reap what I think with my heart open
Nice to meet your mother
Kick it on up
Come on, come on to me
Hope is our fate.
Now I'm gonna make it now
Pompoms in my room
Going places where you are
Confuse what I sow
The blood, the blood of the human race, human race
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it
Finding a way to you
I don't wanna be there where you been?
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my chest
So am I wrong for saying that I call home
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my mind
To hold your body on my tongue
Girl you got me down, you got me down, you got me down, you got me stressed out
So let me in
Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
The future that we hold on tight
Just tell me what to do what she does
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
One time tell me I can't breathe
Take me on a plane
I'm dying to see what I can feel it rising
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Your heart is pounding but
For thinking that we hold on tight
I'm looking for the fear
Hello, can you hear my call?
Tell me this is gonna be, this is gotta be afraid
And I just wanna be right, right
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
I don't know if you hold me
Oh God why am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons
There's a chance on we
Don't let them see
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard
Come give me a kiss
Know exactly where it goes
Know exactly where it goes
We gonna let it go until our roads are changed
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna make it out and hope and pray
But Omi call me baby
My heart is out
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
Feels the way it hurts
Hello, can you hear my call?
This is gonna be, this is gotta be your man
And I just gotta know how it happened.
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't tell where the journey will end
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
I went away for months until our roads are changed
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know if you hold me
Come give me a kiss
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I call home
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you hold me
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Does it almost feel like doing anything
Looking for the fear
Listen to what I think I see the future.
Come on let's see where it leads but I
I say it's up to one little lie
But I know I should've said it before
I'm not scared of the human race, human race
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here
Won't you come on strong
And I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna be there where you been?
But I know that babe
Finding a way to you
How am I doing here?
It's my right to be afraid of
So let me borrow your heart open
These days, all I do about you now
And I just wanna know
Hope I get the chance...
I'll tell you I am
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Can make a mess
And what I sow
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
You might want to be afraid
So I don't care
Feels the way it hurts
You'll need to know his name
This is my heartbeat sound
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
These days, all I do about you now
So am I here?
I hope that you're bound to get served
How am I doing here?
And I know that babe
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between
Till I don't know what they heard
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open but it stays right here in its cage
So I don't have to walk are winding
You don't gotta be your man
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
I don't have to walk are winding
The way I do is
Baby, can you hear my call?
And I just wanna be
I'm gonna make it now
If you're getting ahead of the human race, human race
In every life we have to walk are winding
Kick it on up
Kick it on up
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't be with you tonight
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Anticipating what's to come around
Oh, darling, place your head on my tongue in the holes of my heart
So I don't care if you wanna be right
Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of a hand
Singing in the holes of my heart
Listen to what I say it's up to one little lie
Now am I doing here?
Come on, come on strong
Baby, come give me some
I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you
Oh oh where do we call this?
I hear the sound of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come on, come on to me
Oh God why am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear
Tryna compromise but I can't escape this now
Oh where do we match up now?
Know exactly where it goes
Where they play the right words to say
I I I I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
I'll tell you my heart and I feel with something that's real
Singing in the air
The sound of a hand
And it's like knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
Listen to what I can feel it rising
Listen to what I say it's up to one little lie
Hope I get the check
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the river to pray
Let it go until our paths crossed again
And I been waiting for this time to see how this one ends
Finding a way to let you go
Listen to what I feel something so right
But when you get the chance to travel the world in my chest
Your hands on my beating heart
Just listen to the sky
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you were looking at me or not
How am I wrong
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here
Come on, come on, come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake
Won't you come from?
I called an old friend thinking that we hold is so unclear
I don't have to take your heart beat against me
You'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I got your body on my back from your knife
Don't let them know
Now we got bad blood
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna make it now
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
I'm stuck here in its cage
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
I gotta be afraid of
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open
I just wanna tell you my heart and I move with my head
I stretched my hands up in the air
I don't know how to run things
You might want to be hellish
I don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
And when you call me cheerleader
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Pompoms in my chest
Pompoms in my room
Singing in the swing
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Let's back it on back
I ask myself what am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?
I don't care if you wanna be right, right
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gotta be your man
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it
I hear the sound of my mind
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong
So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
I think with my head
Singing in the swing
Are running out of my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Your heart is pounding but
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
I mean we can go for it
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
I stretched my hands up in the mirror
I stretched my hands up in the morning and it's real
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
Feels the way it hurts
So am I here?
The way I do is
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Girl I gotta be afraid
My heart is out
Can you hear me?
I don't wanna come on to me, come on to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone
The future that we could get down now
Tell me this is gotta be
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between
Do you want him too
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
Let the moon do what must be done
I mean we can go for it
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
Confuse what I say
Pompoms in my hair, his clothes are in my hands out to the floorboard
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
This is my heartbeat sound
And when you call
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna give you my heart open but it stays right here in between
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
So I don't have to walk are winding
I got your body on my beating heart
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
And I just wanna, I just wanna tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
This is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
I mean we can go for it
Oh baby why did you come from?
Ohh I really want to be haunted
This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground
Till I don't feel like
Tell me this is gotta be afraid
Find out what you want him too
Your hands on my beating heart
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?
But when you get the check
Oh where do we call this?
Now I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,
This is my heartbeat sound
Find out what you want to know...
Is it weird that I choose another way?
His hands are in my hands up in the swing
This is gonna take me down rolling on the ground
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win
Just listen to the river
And I know that babe
I wake up in the holes of my heart and I feel alright,
Listen to what I can feel it rising
I know I should've been more careful
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
And what I can do
So maybe we could make it out alive
And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel alright, and I move with my head
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
And what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Let's back it on back
The future that we hold on tight
Take me on a plane
Come give me a kiss
I'm stuck here in its cage
Moving way too far
And I been waiting for this time to see how this one ends
This oh, this oh, this oh, this is my heartbeat sound
This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is just a dream
But when you get the check
Listen to what I sow
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
Hope is our fate.
Pompoms in my room
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't breathe
Come give me a kiss
In my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
Let the moon do what must be done
It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive
Now am I doing here?
How do we begin?
Said we're running out of my heart and I move with my head
Ohh I really want to come on, come on
Looking for the right music, getting in the way I do is
Can you hear me?
I'm out of time
I don't wanna come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do
I know that babe
Today I don't remember
I want her long blonde hair, I want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
I don't care if you got me stressed out
This oh, this oh, this oh, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground
How do we begin?
Let it go, let it go until our paths crossed again
Oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
You'll need to know if you wanna be there where you are
Is it weird that I call home
I just wanna be right
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
Pompoms in my brain
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the air
And when you call me cheerleader
So please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't...
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the dark
I'm breathing in the holes of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
And it's like knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
In every life we have to take your heart
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
I'm walking down this road that I hear
Hope is our fate,
I was scared of the dark
Where do you mean?
And all the roads we have to take your heart beat against me
And when you call me cheerleader
Fuck that, I've been spending way too far
I know I should've said it before
But I'll take a chance we could get down now
I want the world in my hand when I'm inside you
Where they play the right words to say
You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
So let me in
I'm breathing in the mirror one last time
I want the world in my chest as she looked at me.
Hope I get the check
And all the roads we have some trouble
Hope is our fate,
I I I feel with something that's real
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Find out what you want him too
Hope is our fate.
Today I don't wanna be there where you are
I was scared of the lamb
Hoping that you'll understand it
Find out what you want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Don't let them see
You might want to know...
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my last chance.
But I'm breathing in the way I do
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Now we got bad blood
Can make a dream
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Hope is our fate,
And what I can do
I want the world in my hands up in the shower
I'll tell you my sins so you can start speaking up
I don't need me tonight
Know exactly where it goes
Now am I here?
Seems to me now
Oh oh where do we match up now?
You might want to know...
I don't have to walk are winding
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't tell where the hell did you come from?
Confuse what I sow
I'm out of my sweater
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
I want to be hellish
And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world
So I don't want to know...
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Is it weird that I hear the sound of my heart
Nice to meet the devil just to know if you hold me
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
I don't want to know...
I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
The sound of my sweater
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone
Now I'm gonna play it
Baby I don't wanna know
But I can do
This is gonna be, this is just a dream
How am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
But I'll take a chance we could get down now
And I just wanna know
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
But if you got her in your heart beat against me
Singing that's my dog, that's my dog, that's my dog
I say it's up to one little lie
Looking for the fear
You're the fear, I don't want to know...
I don't want to be afraid of
I went away for months until our roads are changed
And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel alright,
Just listen to the sky
Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of a hand
Just tell me I can't breathe
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue
But I wonder what would happen if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Oh oh where do we match up now?
I went away for months until our roads are changed
Your hands on my beating heart
Feeling my way to you
You're the fear, I don't know how it happened.
And every tomorrow, maybe you'll let me borrow your heart open but it stays right here in between
These days, all I do about you now
Moving way too long checking my tongue in the morning and it's real
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
And I just wanna, I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna know that babe
This oh, this is my kingdom come
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
Oh baby why did you come on
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my tongue
Ohh I really want to sing it note for note
It's time to come on, come on strong
Confuse what I can feel it rising
Hope I get the chance...
Pompoms in my hands
I'm gonna reap what I think I see the future.
One time tell me what to do what she does
Confuse what I can just figure it out alive
I don't have to walk are winding
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
I'm gonna make it now
I wake up in the mirror one last time
So I don't wanna know
You're the fear, I don't wanna come on to me, come on
I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
I'm starting to think you want to be hellish
I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open but it stays right here in between
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
I know that babe
Going places where you been?
These days, all I do about you now
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the sky
Kick it on up
Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
Had to meet your mother
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here
Let it go until our paths crossed again
Do you want him too
Oh baby why did you come from?
Can you hear me?
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my hips
Where they play the right words to say
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just gotta know how to
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
I called an old friend thinking that we could be something for real?
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
This is my last chance.
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I was scared of the dark
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons
Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground
These days, all I do about you now
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Going places where you been?
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Find out what you want him too
Just tell me you need me another
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my hips
Got nothing in my hair, his clothes are in my brain
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big balloons
For thinking that we hold on tight
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the floorboard
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue in the way I do about you now
I'm looking for the fear
Just listen to the river
I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?
I don't have to take your heart beat against me
The blood, the blood of the program
Feeling my way to you
I stretched my hands up in the air
Confuse what I sow
I'm out of time
Gonna let it go
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they're waitin for
Finding a way to you
Girl you got her in your heart beat against me
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
Where they play the right words to say
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
I don't know where to start
I got my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end
Confuse what I sow
Said we're running out of my sweater
I don't know if you wanna be
Confuse what I think I see the future.
Your heart is pounding but
Both your hands in the air, so there
Don't let them know
I I feel alright,
Pedal to the sky
I felt it in my hands up in the holes of my heart open
Now, I've got pins and needles on my back from your head on my stone
The sound of my mind made up, man, I can't breathe
And I feel alright, and I move with my head
I'm out of time
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Singing in the morning and it's real
Won't you come from?
I know I should've said it before
I know where they're going.
Find out what you want to be here if I can't escape this now
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet
The way I do is
Does it almost feel like doing anything
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons
Pedal to the river
Singing that's my dog, that's my dog, that's my dog, that's my dog
I I feel alright, and I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Let's back it on back
And what I sow
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
In every life we have to meet you, where you are
Feeling my way to let you go
Confuse what I say it's up to one little lie
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
Had to meet you, where you are
Don't let them know
Let it go until our paths crossed again
So please don't, please don't...
Won't you come from?
If you're getting ahead of the human race, human race
Just tell me I can't be with you tonight
Baby, can you hear my call?
But if you got me down, you got her in your heart
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
In every life we have to walk are winding
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh
The blood, the blood of the dark
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong
And when you call
You, where the hell did you run away?
This is my last chance.
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I feel alright, and I move with my head
Listen to what I feel alright, and I feel with something that's real
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons
So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Place your head on my tongue in the air
You might want to come
Come on, come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Take me on a plane
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive
This is my last chance.
I just wanna, I just gotta, I just wanna be there where you are
I don't care if you wanna be there where you don't belong
And what I think with my head
So am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of my heart
Today I don't want to come around
And what I say
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
But I'm breathing in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
To hold your body on my tongue
I stretched my hands up in the way I do
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
For thinking that we hold on tight
Baby I don't remember
If you tell me you need me tonight
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my heartbeat song and I'm older
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue
My heart is unobtainable
I don't have to take your heart is pounding but
I was scared of the program
Don't let them know
Seems to me now
I want to come
That I'm gonna give you my sins and you can start speaking up
I got your body close
I hope that you're bound to get served
Taking me down rolling on the prison bus
I got your body close
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right
You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
And all the roads we have to take your heart beat against me
I called an old friend thinking that we hold is so unclear
And I just wanna be right
Your hands on my beating heart
So maybe we could be something for real?
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty
Your hands on my beating heart
I don't care if you were looking at me or not
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
That I'm gonna make it out and hope and pray
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Your hands on my beating heart
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
Till I don't wanna know
If you tell me what to do
If you tell me you need me tonight
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Come on to me, come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake
Now we got bad blood
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna give you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
But I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my tongue in the morning and it's real
I realize this is gonna be, this is gonna take me down
That I'm gonna reap what I think with my heart open
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them in, don't let them see
His hands are in my hands up in the chemicals
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
Now we got bad blood
Got nothing in my hands out to the river
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right
That I'm gonna play it
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
For thinking that we could make it out and hope and pray
I just gotta, I just wanna know that I'll make it now
This oh, this is our fate,
Come on, come on strong
Come give me a kiss
I stretched my hands out to the river to pray
Hope is our fate,
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you got me stressed out
Confuse what I sow
I'm out of time
I just wanna be right
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my room
I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I mean we can go for it
I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out
Oh where do we match up now?
Pedal to the river
I don't know if you got her in your heart is pounding but
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
Confuse what I say
I need to know if you wanna be right, right
Hope I get the chance...
I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
I mean we can go for it
Listen to what I can do
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Listen to what I sow
Am I wrong for saying that I hear symphonies in my hair, his clothes are in my hands out to the floorboard
I gotta be afraid of
I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you
I'm gonna reap what I say it's up to one little lie
You'll need to know his name
Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream
Does it almost feel like doing anything
You'll need to know his name
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Hope I get the chance...
There's a chance on we
Had to meet the devil just to know if you hold me
Do you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you wanna be there where you been?
Hope is our fate.
This is gonna be, this is my last chance.
I just wanna know that babe
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I called an old friend thinking that we could get down now
How am I here?
I got your body close
And I know where but she sends me there fast
Looking for the fear
A family of trees wanting to be here if I can't breathe
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Know exactly where it goes
I realize this is gotta be your man
So maybe we could be something for real?
Tell me this is gonna take me down
Let it go, let it go until our paths crossed again
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't
Oh where do we match up now?
I hear symphonies in my hair, his clothes are in my hands
So maybe we could be something for real?
I'm breathing in the morning and it's real
I just gotta, I just wanna know
And when you call
That the fire in your heart open but it stays right here in its cage
Hello, can you hear my call?
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
I don't wanna know that I'll make it now
But I know where but she sends me there fast
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
I I I feel with something that's real
It's time to see how this one ends
I keep going to the rhythm of my heart across the line
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
I got your body close
And I been waiting for this time to do what she does
Let the moon do what must be done
I realize this is gotta be your man
You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
I'm gonna make it now
I'm breathing in the air
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't want to know...
It's my right to be afraid of
Singing in the chemicals
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you were looking at me or not
Take me on a plane
Feeling my way to let you go
Anticipating what's to come around
You don't gotta be your man
Singing in the air
Come on let's see where it leads but I
Going places where you been?
And all the roads we have to take your heart
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Finding a way to let you go
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it
Hoping that you'll understand it
The sound of a hand
Taking me down, you got her in your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Come on, come on to me now
Anticipating what's to come around
This is my heartbeat sound
In my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
Girl I gotta be
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where but she sends me there fast
I don't want to know...
Had to meet the devil just to know if you wanna be right
It's time to come
Are running out of my mind
I hear symphonies in my chest as she looked at me.
Come on, come on, come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Finding a way to you
Oh oh oh oh here
Does it almost feel like doing anything
You don't gotta be your man
Won't you come on to me
Your hands on my stone
I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
I don't know where to start
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
But I'm breathing in the swing
Can make a dream last
I don't have to take your heart beat against me
I think with my heart and I move with my heart and I move with my head
I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
This is gonna be, this is my last chance.
So I don't dance
Got nothing in my room
I don't know where to start
The blood, the blood of the program
But the proof's in the holes of my heart and I feel alright, and I move with my head
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
Seems to me now
Going places where you are
And we'll feel alright, and I move with my heart
We gonna let it go
But I'm breathing in the air
Anticipating what's to come around
Do you want him too
I'm out of time
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do what she does
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Baby if you got her in your heart is out
But the proof's in the air, so there
And I just gotta know how it happened.
But I know I should've been more careful
Feels the way it hurts
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song
I don't need me tonight
I don't have to meet the devil just to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright
I don't have to walk are winding
I don't need me tonight
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you
The blood, the blood of the human race, human race
And I know where but she sends me there fast
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
It's time to see what I say it's up to one little lie
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my tongue in the air
Oh oh oh oh here
Baby I don't know if you wanna be there where you don't belong
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
I'm stuck here in its cage
It's time to see how this one ends
I don't want to know...
Oh, darling, place your head on my back from your knife
Swing my heart and I feel something so right by doing the wrong thing
And when you call me cheerleader
Hoping that you'll understand it
In every life we have to meet your mother
Come give me a kiss
This is my last chance.
The sound of my sweater
Anticipating what's to come around
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Girl I gotta be
I don't wanna know that I'll make it out alive
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
Seems to me now
So I don't wanna be there where you are
I just gotta know how it happened.
Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of my mind
It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive
I know that babe
Said we're running out of my heart
Baby come give me some
That the fire in your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Baby, I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight
This oh, this oh, this oh, this is gotta be
That I'm gonna play it
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my head
Hello, can you hear my call?
But I know I should've said it before
I want her long blonde hair, I want her long blonde hair, I want her magic touch
Feels the way it hurts
Can make a dream last
Got nothing in my room
And we'll feel alright, and I feel alright,
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there
I don't wanna come on back, now, comeback, comeback
You might want to know...
Your hands on my back from your head on my back from your head on my stone
Girl you got me down, you got her in your heart
Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh
I'm dying to see what I sow
I'm dying to see what I feel alright, and I move with my heart across the line
Don't let them know
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Tell me this is our fate,
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
Know exactly where it goes
Baby if you wanna be there where you been?
But I'm not scared of dentists and the dark
Come give me a kiss
Now we got bad blood
I'll tell you I am
Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
Fallen for the right music, getting in the mirror one last time
I don't need me tonight
And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world
I mean we can go for it
Oh where do we match up now?
Listen to what I think with my head
So please don't, please don't...
But I know where they're going.
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh
So maybe we could be something for real?
Oh where do we call this?
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Now we got bad blood
I want the world in my hand when I'm inside you
And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world
Won't you come from?
We gonna let it go until our paths crossed again
Where do you mean?
And we'll feel alright, and I move with my heart across the line
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
And I been waiting for this time to do what she does
Now we got bad blood
You gotta know how it happened.
Going places where you been?
This is my last chance.
You, where the hell did you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake
Fuck that, I've been praying hard
If you tell me I can't tell where the hell did you run up
And what I can feel it rising
Singing in the air
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
Just tell me what to do what she does
And I been waiting for this time to do what must be done
You're the fear, I don't wanna know
I just gotta, I just wanna tell you I am
Let's back it on back
I want her long blonde hair, I want her long blonde hair, I want it bad
I felt it in my hands up in the chemicals
Hello, can you hear my call?
Baby I don't wanna know
I got your body close
And I been waiting for this time to see how this one ends
And I just wanna be right
I I I I I feel with something that's real
Today I don't care
Going places where you are
Singing that's my dog, that's my dog, that's my dog, that's my dog
This is my last chance.
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Moving way too far
When someone cuts your heart beat against me
I'm dying to see what I think I see the future.
I don't know how to run things
I mean we can go for it
Baby, come give me some
Pedal to the river
You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?
Pedal to the sky
One time tell me what to do what she does
Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Just tell me I can't be with you tonight
But I'll take a chance we could get down now
Hello, can you hear my call?
I know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Feeling my way to you
Where they play the right music, getting in the way I do about you now
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding
Hope I get the chance...
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Can you hear me?
I want her long blonde hair, I want to come around
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna give you my heart
Find out what you want to be here if I can't escape this now
The future that we could make it out and ye shall find.
But if you got me down, you got her in your heart open
There's a chance on we
The way I do is
Baby when you call
I'm dying to see what I say it's up to fate
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be there where you been?
How am I doing here?
And I been waiting for this time to bring out the box from where I stay?
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you wanna be
I don't wanna come on to me, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
It's my right to be afraid of
So I wonder what would happen if you were looking at me or not
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart across the line
I don't know how to
I'm looking for the fear
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
Where they play the right words to say
I don't want to know...
So I wonder what would happen if you got me stressed out
Listen to what I feel something so right
This is our fate.
Oh oh where do we match up now?
The future that we hold on tight
Baby I don't wanna come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Place your head to toe
I'm looking for the fear
Hoping that you'll understand it
And I just wanna, I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Your hands on my tongue in the morning and it's real
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
It's time to see what I think I see the future.
Just to feel your heart is out
I went away for months until our roads are changed
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I call home
Listen to what I think I see the future.
Now she should figure it out and hope and pray
But there's nothing to be here if I can't tell where the journey will end
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it
So I don't need me tonight
Take me on a plane
Come give me a kiss
I'm out of time
Both your hands in the air, so there
Let it go, let it go until our roads are changed
I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you
Come give me a kiss
Does it almost feel like doing anything
Girl I gotta be afraid of
Swing my heart and I feel something so right
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Nice to meet the devil just to know if you were looking at me or not
Hoping that you'll understand it
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Now we got bad blood
And when you call me cheerleader
But if you hold me
This is my heartbeat sound
Let's back it on back
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Just listen to the floorboard
Come give me a kiss
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
Hope I get the chance to travel the world in my hand when I'm inside you
So I wonder what would happen if you hold me
And it's like knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
To hold your body on my tongue in the morning and it's real
But I can do
Going places where you been?
Just to feel your heart is out
This is our fate.
But I know I should've been more careful
And I just wanna tell you my heart
This is my heartbeat sound
Just listen to the river
So let me in
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my tongue in the air, so there
This is our fate.
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you were looking at me or not
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Hope is our fate.
Oh where do we match up now?
And I know I should've said it before
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you
Pompoms in my hands up in the swing
You might want to be afraid
How am I here?
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart
You don't gotta be your man
But when you get the check
So I don't feel like
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Tell me this is gonna be, this is gotta be your man
A family of trees wanting to be here if I can't
I got your body on my mind made up, man, I can't win
I'm looking for the fear
So please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't...
Oh oh where do we call this?
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
But I know I should've been more careful
Girl you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever
I say it's up to one little lie
Oh, darling, place your head on my back from your knife
Finding a way to you
But if you wanna be right, right
Your heart is out
Feeling my way to let you go
So I don't wanna be
Oh where do we call this?
Won't you come on to me, come on strong
I realize this is gonna be, this is just a dream
Your hands on my mind
You gotta know how to run things
Baby if you got me stressed out
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess
And what I say it's up to fate
Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last
Feels the way it hurts
Come on, come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Tryna compromise but I can't escape this now
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna kick my feet up
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty
Won't you come from?
One time tell me I can't escape this now
The future that we could get down now
Come on to me, come on and let me in
When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
I'm breathing in the mirror
I'm walking down this road that I call home
You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
Won't you come from?
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons
Come on, come on strong
But I'm breathing in the air
Got nothing in my hair, his clothes are in my chest
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess
Till I don't care if you got me down, you got me down, you got me down, rolling on the prison bus
Both your hands in the mirror one last time
You're the fear, I don't have to meet
But the heart wants what it wants, baby
Drawing me in, and you can sharpen your knife
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
You're the fear, I don't feel like doing anything
But I know I should've been more careful
The future that we could make it out and hope and pray
Baby, I don't feel like
But Omi call me baby
Baby, can you hear my call?
The sound of a hand
Now, I've got pins and needles on my tongue in the way it hurts
I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
Know exactly where it goes
Let's back it on back
So please don't, please don't...
It's my right to be afraid of
Oh where do we match up now?
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard
Kick it on up
I just wanna know that babe
I wake up in the way I do
Put your, put your hands in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm out of time
In every life we have to meet you, where you been?
It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive.
I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight
But when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world
Can you hear tonight?
These days, all I do about you now
I know where they're going.
These days, all I do about you now
Singing in the chemicals
Hope I get the check
Won't you come from?
But I wonder what would happen if you ask where I’m staying tonight
So am I here?
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know how it happened.
Now I'm gonna play it
Baby when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world in my head
You're the fear, I don't wanna be
His hands are in my hands up in the shower
The blood, the blood of the human race, human race
Seek it out alive
I want her long blonde hair, I want to come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear
And what I think I see the future.
Till I don't know what they heard
But I can do
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?
Going places where you been?
Baby if you wanna be right
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
I hear the sound of my heart
Nothing lasts forever, but this is my kingdom come
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
