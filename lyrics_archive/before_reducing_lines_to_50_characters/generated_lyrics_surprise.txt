Something tells me that there’s something strange
If I showed him all the things that I would feel it,
So tell my friends that I'll let him down easy
Say oh I think that I forgot I had me a bottle of water filled with thorns
Oh I think that I ever did before
Every inch of your hand, girl
Think of you again
I played my cards and I thought that we were one
Said you're on and twist
I'm just a lie?
But we get along when I'm going to bed
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Clap!
Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh
Sounding like a feature
We took the floor and she got me in hindsight
Guess it's true, I'm not that bold
So let me down
And it's a hundred degrees
Saw you there and I didn't know I would feel it,
This is the prize
Anything you want it, you know who you are
Oh, in your hair down, and take a look what you've done
But they’re not quite what they don't know, mmm-mmm
And you're not to do
And now you're in my birthday suit
Did you think it all
And I'll bet the odds against it all through? All these things will catch up to the seatback right beside me
Yeah, I may snap and I know she must be kind
Something meaty for the club
You'll see me in chains
Anything you want I'll give it to you
Z71 like a wrecking ball
Oh, Lord, got a river for a dance
I promise, after that I'll be here
And now, you're not to do
All we did was care for you, you, you got me wired
Trust and respect is what I got the sheets on the floor and she said,
There are many things that I got I got
I'm kinda older than I was when I heard that groove
And you know, and you know what I've discovered
Saturday morning jumped out of that town
And even though your friends tell me that deathless death
And I'll bet the odds against it all through? All these things will catch up to the top
And you know, and you know Backwoods what I roll
Hello from the bottom to the door
Say oh I think about
They say I'm crazy
Though this is crazy,

They ain't make me richer
Buy me a boy,
Yah, you got when you ready I ain't never letting go
To make it like your birthday suit
But I don't know she must be kind
Knocked on your timepiece.
It's late in the palm of your hand
Confused what I got
I could give you a question
So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes
So I'll be at your door with heart in my hand
Your lipstick stain is a holy grail I've got to find
Girl when you call unexpected
Buy-buying what you done started
You're crazy and I'm out of that town
So I love when you were 16
And all those things I didn't warn ya
You love it when I saw you
Ain't got no gal to make you move like that, yeah
And caught up in the evening
And bending over backwards just to find out
They ain't make me richer
But we get along when I'm going to bed
Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't never letting go
Your kiss has got me in chains
This DJ's on a plane
Baby, do you any good,
Of people waiting out the big balloons
Realized what you're not coming down
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s pullin’ you in
Lovin', is what I roll
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s pullin’ you in
He may have to wait
But I stopped real quick when I lose I'm winning
They say I'm crazy
To another galaxy, you know Backwoods what I got this music
You come in to look for a promise or commitment
Bar downtown, they got a river for a second
Your kiss has got me in the palm of your skin is a man
Z71 like a wrecking ball
He sees them talking with a big smile, but they haven't got a whole lot to show for it
You love it when I saw ya walking out the big balloons
It's like I got to have a surprise
And those shows have never been laid so low
I can't believe you let me get you in your darkest nights
Ain't got no gal to make you move like that, yeah

Oh, I was ready
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a give you better
Just for a lifetime

I think that I ever did before
Realized what you like, yeah

Now did you think I'm pretty

And I will stay in chains
Hello from the bottom to the seatback right beside me
Do you think it all
I'm gonna take you down eat you alive
Oh, yes I said hey
And I know, and you know who I am is a work of art
To another galaxy, you know who you are
Saw you there and I didn't warn ya
Z71 like a zillion bucks on a plane
Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it clearer
but mama raised me right.
Put it on up
Lovin', is what we do this for a lifetime
Oh, you're changing your heart and you'll find that the both of us
I'll give you what you done started
So I love when you were 16
That's what I got to have you
I promise, after that I'll let a stranger pull me on the street
Oh, I was lost
It's Mardi Gras up in a thing called love
Your lipstick stain is a holy grail I've got to have you
Only then I let him down easy
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that kind of fun
Only then I am is a man
Back it on me
And those shows have never been this far
Oh, I could give you what you asked for
To make it out of bed
To another galaxy, you know who you are
I didn't know I was there for you
When I look in your birthday suit
I'll give it to you
But since my friends are turning green
Thought I had me a kiss
Won't do you believe, I'm yours.
Say oh I think that I think I saw you
Sweetheart bitterheart now I can't believe you let her go
You come in to look for a promise or commitment
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule.
I can't believe you let her go
Cause I taped your picture to the money, I ain't gotta call you mine
Of people waiting out the big balloons
Say oh I think that I would like to say to you right, yeah
You got me in the U.S.A.
She jumped up and run
In love with the money, introduced her to my stove
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't never letting go
And I didn't warn ya
You know you love her when you let me get you in your darkest time
Trust and respect is what I got
Whoa, I'm never gonna give it to you
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Didn't know I was there for you
They ain't make me richer
Something meaty for the club
But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
She knows what for
So you can tell everybody
Baby, when I sing
To another I will not lie
I'll, I'll up and cut me off
I'm drunk on a track
Didn't know I was there for you
So take a sip
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that kind of luxe just ain't for us.
Trust and respect is what I always thought
Bar downtown, they got a river for a promise or commitment
Only then I let him down easy
And I didn't say, I didn't say, I didn't know I would like to say to you
But we get along when I'm going to bed
Whatever you got me
So holla at me I'll be at your door with heart in my hand
What you got in the palm of your skin is a holy grail I've got to have a house party
You're a different, different kind of luxe just ain't for us.
And those shows have never been this far
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a pick you up in the evening
I don't know me
I guess that I found myself a cheerleader
Confused what I got, I said it
In love with the law, but he live in a straight line, that's not really her style.
Knocked on your timepiece.
I'll, I'll up and cut me off
All we did was care for you, you, you
Trust and respect is what I got, now remember that
But for you like a Cadillac
Born in the 40s, centerfold in the palm of your hand, girl
And even though your friends tell me when you want
She sees them talking with a big smile, but they haven't got a river for a lifetime
And you know, and you know, and you know, and I didn't know I would feel it,
And I'll bet the odds against it all through? All these things will catch up to you
Well you let me down
And I will stay true
Yes, I do, I believe in a thing called love
That's what I am, they just found me like a Cadillac
I'll keep you like a zillion bucks on a plane
But I can survive
I told her she knows what I got
Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it now
Lean on, lean on...
So holla at me I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Eight up in the real world
I'd hold you closer than I was ready
Baby, when I sing
And I know she shines for us
I promise, after that, I'll let a stranger pull me on the road
And you let me down
And I didn't say
Girl you had good, but I could show you incredible things
And I've been before
So, shawty, let your hair down, and take a look what you've done
Oh I think that I can read you like it sweet
So I love when you were 16
Whatever you got when you call unexpected
Born in the 50s
She knows what for
And that's when my love was gonna hurt
What you got exactly what you gotta do
I was when I heard that groove
I've never been laid so low, low, low
You make it look so easy
But the pilot, it's a hundred degrees
There are many things that I can work a miracle
But we get along when I'm going to bed
I know you got me in the face
I'll keep you like it sweet
That I'll be over here
So tell my friends are here
And I will not lie
If today I woke up with you all night long
Do you think it would?
And everyone who knows us knows that I'm growing too old
True love was burning
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a give it up
It's like I got a river for a lifetime
They ain't make me richer
She's heading for something that she peeled off and hung up
Lean on, lean on...
She's heading for something that she peeled off and hung up
Guess it's true, I'm not that old
Z71 like a feature
Buy-buying what you want
Oh, you're changing your heart and you'll find that the sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
In love with the money, introduced her to my stove
Here's a little song I wrote this song I wrote this song I wrote
I told her she knows what I got, I got

Lovin', is what I got I got her, and she got me in hindsight
Yes, I do, I believe in a palace
I promise, after that, I'll let him go
I'm a make you smile
I believe every lie that I found myself a cheerleader

God knew exactly what he was getting some coins
And I know, and I thought it'd make me what I got, now remember that
Buy-buying what you asked for
I didn't say, I didn't know I would like to say to you
They all tell me when you call unexpected
To another galaxy, you know who you are
Hello from the bottom to the party.

Sounding like a wrecking ball

Put it on up
So, put a posy in your birthday suit
You say I'm caught up in a straight line, that's not really her style.
Before I walked her to my stove
I'm a pick you up in the real world
Knocked on your body
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
And I don't care
God knew exactly what you done started
And bending over backwards just to find out that my love was gonna hurt
So I love when you let me know

And I know you love her when you were 16
Then she handed me a boy, turned him into a man
I could show you how
And everyone who knows us knows that I'm growing too old
That I'll be in the stable?
And I didn't say, I didn't fold

A star in the face
You got me wired
And you know, and you know that I'm growing too old

And now, you're someone else
Baby, I'm just a boy,
It's late in the U.S.A.
Guess you got me wired
And I will stay true

Oh, Lord, got a river for a lifetime
Oh, you know that I'm so down
And even though your friends tell me that she peeled off and hung up
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a make you say

Showed her how to treat me like a drug
There are many things that he didn't understand
I'm a make you smile
And I've been before

We're gonna have a surprise
But since my friends that I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one.
And those shows have never been this far
I think I saw ya walking out the big balloons
Back beat, the word is on the floor and she said,
Lovin', is what I always thought
Every inch of you again
But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the mountain tonight
Well, I had a choice
Every inch of your hand, girl
And all those things I didn't warn ya
A star in the evening
So I'ma care for each other
I think that I think I see it clearer
But still, you're in my birthday suit
You best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, I'm yours?
And now, you're someone else
Every inch of your hand, girl
Buy-buying what you done started
Did you ever make it easy, you lie
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud
I believe every lie that I think that I ever did before
And deep down I know you came from it and someday you'll return to it
And I said it
The sky is yours.
And I don't know me
I have a house party
And you know Backwoods what I thought with something I felt
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that kind of dress
This ain't love, it's clear to see it all, I see you
Eight up in this world
Think of you is perfect from the outside
Eight up in a Cadillac
Rose garden filled with tequila.
I know that I found myself a cheerleader
In love with the money, introduced her to my own hero
A star in the palm of your skin is a work of art
I'm stronger than I've been thinking about it lately
But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the street
Sounding like a Cadillac
I'm a pick you up in the U.S.A.
And bending over backwards just to find out that my love was gonna hurt
All up on TV, I thought that we were one
And that's when my love was gonna hurt
Call all the things that I would like to say to you right, yeah
She knows how to rock
Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it now
To ask you a taste
I don't even know it yet
I believe every lie that I got a river for a king
Though this is all for you like this
Out of my mind
Ain't it fun living in the mood for a promise or commitment
That kind of fun
Yes, I do, I believe in a Cadillac
God knew exactly what he was getting some coins
And I know, and you know who you are
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
I have a good shot
I'm gonna show you incredible things
And I've been before
You know you ready
I don't even know it yet
The hounds will stay up through the night
Though this is crazy,
Well I'm just a lie?
And now you're in my birthday suit
This DJ's on a plane
This DJ's on a track
The sky is yours.
So you can tell everybody
So let me know
Baby, do you any good,
Girl when you were 16
Guess you got on, girl, stay in chains
Eight up in a palace

I believe in a Cadillac
Do you think it all
Then she handed me a boy, turned him into a man
I'm gonna show you incredible things
Back beat, the word is on the train to the door
Did you ever make it easy, you lie
I see it all, I see it all, I see it clearer
And I don't care I'm down for what you gotta do
God knew exactly what you need
And those shows have never been laid so low, low, low
I got to have a house party
Tangled up with a plane
A star in the evening
Ain't it fun living in the palm of your skin is a work of art
She sees them walking in a thing called love
I'm getting red in the car when you're near me
Well, I had a choice
I'm a give you better
Your kiss has got me in the real world
So tell my friends are turning green
And it's a party
Oh, all my friends that I'll let you go
It's late in the real world
Confused what I always thought
And so I drew a new face and I know, and you know who you are
She knows what I think that I can read you like an oath
You love it when I revelled without a care
They ain't make me what I thought it'd make me richer
They say I'm crazy
Realized what you like, yeah
If today I woke up with a plane
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
And I don't know she must be kind
Look what you asked for
He sees them talking with a plane ticket
Oh, You know you like this
I'm a give you better
But it's in my birthday suit
But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
You look good, I will stay true
You love it when I heard that groove
Saw you there and I know, and I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
They all tell me when you were 16
Every inch of your hand
But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
I wasn't looking for anything right now
Lovin', is what I got I got I got
I played my cards and I know, and you know who you are
Saw you there and I thought that I'd been hurt before
And love is the real world
They say I'm crazy
I can read you like an oath
Cause I'll be over here
You've never seen it look like it's magic, oh, yeah
But I don't even know it yet
Sounding like a wrecking ball
I wasn't looking for anything right now
The hounds will stay up through the night
Buy-buying what you gotta do
There are many things that I can survive
All I am is a work of art
Guess you got all dressed up for the main course
And caught up in a Cadillac
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
Born in the 50s
The way that she’s pullin’ you in your eye
You don't know she must be kind
And I know you ready
I think that I can read you like an oath
I'm gonna show you incredible things
Thought I had a choice
And you should know that I'm growing too old
I could do this for a promise or commitment
So, shawty, let your hair down, and take a look what you've done
Baby, when I sing
I played my cards and I know, and I laughed.
Did you think I'm pretty
To ask you a taste
I'm gonna show you incredible things
We're gonna have a good time
This DJ's on a plane
Only know you got me in the stable?
Here's a little song I wrote this song I wrote
You don't know how to twist
You love it when I revelled without a care
Louder, louder than a tower, I ain't never letting go
Your kiss has got me in hindsight
She don't know how
You know you got exactly what he was doing
A star in the car when you're done
Your lipstick stain is a holy grail I've got to have you
Every inch of your hand
And caught up in a Cadillac
Saturday morning jumped out of that town
Girl I know you ready I ain't ever letting go
You know who I am clean
You know you came you know who I am clean
Your kiss has got me in the stable?
Sounding like a Cadillac
They all tell me when you let her go
So, put a posy in your birthday everyday
I guess that I found myself a cheerleader
She don't know how
It's late in the U.S.A.
I'll make it out of my mind
Eight up in the clouds
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule.
Though this is crazy,
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't never letting go
Something meaty for the club
Then she handed me a boy, turned him into a man
Buy-buying what you want I'll give my all to you
He can't keep his wild eyes on the train to the seatback right beside me
So let me down
Don't say I didn't know I was born without this fear
I could show you how
Girl when you ready I ain't talking about Eiffel's
There are many things that he didn't understand
And I wasn't looking for anything right now
The way that she’s pullin’ you in your hair down, and take a look what you've done
I was there for you like this
We're bigger than a tower, I ain't even gotta check
Realized what you're not coming down
Oh, in your eye
And that's what they seem
You're crazy and I'm out of that town
It's Mardi Gras up in this world
And it's a party
I'll keep you like it sweet
And deep down I know now, that I'm growing too old
She jumped up and run
If today I woke up with you all night long
I think that I forgot I had a good time
And I don't know she must be kind
She don't know me
Before I walked her to the seatback right beside me
They ain't make me richer
And you know, and I move fast
And I said it
But we get along when I'm going to bed
I promise, after that I'll let him down easy
Buy-buying what you asked for
Realized what you're not looking for this,
A star in the face
Whatever you got all dressed up for the main course
I'm kinda older than I ever did before
And you should know that I ever told
But since my friends that I'll let you go
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't gotta leave the house to have a good girl
Z71 like a lady
Said you're on and on, she sees but I could give you a question
Realized what you make
Guess you got exactly what he was doing
Said you're on and on, she sees but I could give you what you make
You best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, I'm yours?
She knows how to treat me like this
Softly smile, I know that I can survive
Dick bigger than a lion
Oh, I could give you what you make
La, la, la, la, lo-ud
All I am clean
I wrote this song I wrote
It's late in the U.S.A.
Yes, I do, I believe in a straight line, that's not really her style.
And love is the real world
Yes, I do, I believe in a dream
Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it clearer
Z71 like a G6
I can't tell you I'm insane
Every inch of your hand, girl
Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh
Knocked on your body
Oh I think I see it clearer
And everyone who knows us knows that I'm so down
Z71 like a zillion bucks on a plane
Now did you think I'm pretty
Oh, yes I said remember that
And you should know that I'm so down

Oh, yes I said hey
And even though your friends tell me when you let me know

She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows
I played my cards and I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old train
I have a good shot
Realized what you asked for
She knows what I thought it'd make me what I got, I got the stamp, though, count up hella them bands though
But I stopped real quick when I lose I'm winning
Thought on your timepiece.
That postgame party field you circle up on TV, I thought with something I felt
All over the track like a wrecking ball
She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows
True love was burning
Well, I had a choice
I can't tell you I'm insane
So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes
I don't know how to twist
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
You're in the 50s
Inside the necklace you got in the car when you're near me
Right now, you're not here
Only know you love her when you ready I ain't talking about Eiffel's
I'm a make you move like that, yeah
Yes, I do, I believe in a straight line, that's not really her style.
Put it on up
And all those things I didn't say, I didn't know I was lost
And I don't care I'm down for what you gotta do
Saturday morning jumped out of my league
Ain't it fun living in the palm of your skin is a work of art
I played my cards and I know, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know
I can't tell you I'm insane
But the pilot, it's a hundred degrees
So put it on up
but mama raised me good, mama raised me good, mama raised me good, mama raised me good, mama raised me right.
Right now, you're not looking for this,
Yah, you got me wired
Guess it's true, I'm not that bold
And I know, and I move fast
That postgame party field you circle up on TV, I thought it'd make me what I got to have you
Rose garden filled with tequila.
God knew exactly what you gotta do
She's heading for something that she peeled off and hung up
She knows what for
So holla at me I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one.
He's so bad but he live in a palace
I wasn't looking for anything right now
The snow glows white on the train to the top
I got to find out
And I didn't know I would like to say to you
Oh, in your birthday suit
The sky is yours.
So holla at me I'll be at your door in ten minutes
She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows what I got, now remember that
There are many things that he didn't understand
Softly smile, I know you got me in the stable?
Said you're on and twist
He may have to wait
So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes
That I'll be over here
Look what you want
You know you got me

To another I will not lie

And you know, and I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot

All we did was care for you, you, you got me
Inside the necklace you got me wired

But still, you're in my birthday suit

To ask you a taste
Look what you want
Won't you let her go
And that's when my love was gonna hurt
We're gonna have a good time

And caught up in a Cadillac
And that's what they seem

You say I'm caught up in a straight line, that's not really her style.
But it's in my hand
She sees them talking with a big smile, but they haven't got a river for a promise or commitment
Inside the necklace you got exactly what he was getting some coins
Remy Boyz got the sheets on the floor
I showed up with you all night
You come in to look for a promise or commitment
They all tell me that she peeled off and hung up
I'm kinda older than I was there for you
Didn't know I was born without this fear
Lovin', is what I think I see you
Now there, is this song I wrote this song I wrote this song just looking at you ooh, oh
Back beat, the word is on the train to the door
To make it look so easy
So take a sip
Z71 like a lady
You make it look so easy
To another galaxy, you know who you are
Whoa, I'm never gonna give it to you
And caught up in a palace
That kind of night
Oh I think that I forgot I had a choice
True love was burning
Realized what you're not coming down
I believe in a Cadillac
I'm kinda older than I ever told
Out of my mind
Something meaty for the club
Trust and respect is what I am, they just found me like this
I'll take care of you when I'm inside you
So hey, I'm getting red in the palm of your hand
Girl when you call unexpected
So I love when you ready I ain't talking about Eiffel's
When I look in your hair down, and take a look what you've done
But the pilot, it's a hundred degrees
But I stopped real quick when I lose I'm winning
What you got me in the mood for a love they won't receive
All I am clean
Don't say I didn't know I would
I think that I think that I ever did before
La, la, la, la, lo-ud
I know you like an oath
So tell my friends are here
Guess you got me wired
Oh, in your hair down, and take a look what you've done
And I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
Love is what I got to have you
That's what I thought it'd make me what I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
I'll keep you like it sweet
In love with the law, but he does it so well
I'm gonna take you down eat you alive
Oh, You know you love her when you want it, you know what I've discovered
You come in to look for a love they won't receive
When I look in your darkest nights
Realized what you make
Now there, is this song looking at you ooh, oh
Showed her how to rock
She's heading for something that she peeled off and hung up
So holla at me I'll be at your door in ten minutes
And it's a hundred degrees
We count our dollars on the mountain tonight
Buy-buying what you done started
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a give it up
Just us, you find out that my love was gonna hurt
I don't know me
I'm a give it up
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a make you smile
Your kiss has got me in chains
But for you like an oath
Now there, is this song looking at you ooh, oh
When I look in your birthday suit
Guess you got on, girl, stay in chains
The way that she’s pullin’ you in your darkest time
Baby, I'm just a boy, turned him into a man
And I will stay in chains
And I know that I'm growing too old
They all tell me that she does
And I didn't know I was there for you
And I know, and you know, and you know, and I know this never works
She sees them talking with a big smile, but they haven't got a river for a dance
Just for a lifetime
And caught up in the U.S.A.
Z71 like a zillion bucks on a plane
Do you think it would?
But I stopped real quick when I revelled without a care
Saw you there and I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
Oh, you know who I am is a work of art
So I'll be over here
Of people waiting out the big balloons
Won't you let her go
Think of you is perfect from the outside
Bar downtown, they got a river for a weekend
Ain't got no gal to make you move like that, yeah
That postgame party field you circle up on TV, I thought
Do you think it would?
I wasn't looking for anything right now
But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
Something meaty for the club
They say it's what you like, yeah
The hounds will stay true
And I will not lie
And I know you got in the stable?
Yeah, I may snap and I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
Lovin', is what I always thought
And even though your friends tell me when you ready
God knew exactly what you asked for
Bar downtown, they got a river for a dance
Knocked on your body
I didn't know I was born without this fear
They ain't make me richer
Oh, I could give you a taste
And you know, and you know who you are
Baby, do you any good,
Oh, you're changing your heart and you'll find that the both of us
Won't you let her go
I don't know how to twist
Did you think it all
Whoa, and then I let him down easy
They ain't make me what I got to have you
And deep down I know when that hotline bling
I don't know how to treat me like this
You know who I am is a man
Oh I think that I got her, and she got me in the clouds
Lean on, lean on...
Oh, in your hair
It's late in the mood for a soul
I believe every lie that I found myself a cheerleader
And I will stay true
Lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on...
You got me in hindsight
Trust and respect is what I got
I just came to raise the dead
Do you think it would?
You're in the face
Look what you make
So I love when you let me get you in
Back it on me
Here's a little song I wrote this song I wrote this song I wrote
And I know, and I thought that I'd been hurt before
Was in shootouts with the money, introduced her to my stove
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out
And caught up in a four door
Oh, You know you came you know that
Turned it on up
Won't you let her go
There are many things that I think that I forgot I had a choice
Every inch of your skin is a work of art
Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh
You make it out of bed
Before I walked her to the seatback right beside me
I showed him all the ladies out
I'm reaching out to you right, yeah
Saw you there and I move fast
Z71 like a wrecking ball
Oh, yes I said remember that
Guess you got exactly what he was doing
Married to the top
And I will not lie
Whoa, and then I am
Yes, I do, I believe in a dream
I'm gonna show you incredible things
Now did you think I'm pretty
Cause I'll be your gift
Louder, louder than a tower, I ain't never letting go
I know now, that I'm growing too old
You're my favorite kind of luxe just ain't for us.
Say my name you know that I'm so down
Sounding like a magazine
but mama raised me right.
There are many things that I think that I forgot I had a choice
That postgame party field you circle up on TV, I thought it'd make me what I got, I said remember that
And you know, and I thought it'd make me what I got, now remember that
And everyone who knows us knows that I'm on my knees
I'm on your body
She jumped up and run
Oh, You know you ready I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Guess it's true, I'm not that old
Won't you let her go
You don't know she must be kind
Whoa, and then I let him down easy
You look good, I will stay true
That I'll be your gift
Oh, in your hair down, and take a look what you've done
And I didn't know I was there for you
He's so bad but he live in a palace
I'll give it to you
And she gave me a boy, turned him into a man
Trust and respect is what I always thought
I know now, that I'm on it
Something tells me that deathless death
Saw you there and I know she shines for us
Anything you want I'll give my all to you
So I'ma care for you, you, you got exactly what he was doing
Oh, Lord, got a clue.
And I didn't know I would like to say to you
Guess you got me wired
Oh, yes I said hey
She knows what for
But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
So tell them I'll be your gift
I think that I would
Said you're on and twist
And all those things I didn't say, I didn't say
I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
Z71 like a drug
I'll keep you like this
You say I'm caught up in a four door
Well, I had a choice
I see it all, I see it all, I see it now
And you let me down
Born in the clouds
Now there, is this song I wrote this song just looking at you ooh, oh
I think I saw ya walking out the big balloons
But the pilot, it's a hundred degrees
She knows how to treat me like a Cadillac
But I thought that we were one
I'd hold you closer than I was lost
I believe in a dream
That I'll be in the 40s, centerfold in the face
Well, I had a choice
They say I'm crazy
Oh, Lord, got a line
And even though your friends tell me that there’s something strange
Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it all, I see it clearer
I'll give you what you done started
I'm getting red in the palm of your skin is a man
Sounding like a feature
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Clap!
There ain't no size two
What you got me
I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
You've never seen it look like it's magic, oh, yeah
It's Mardi Gras up in the palm of your skin is a holy grail I've got to have a good shot
I could give you what you asked for
Thought on your door in ten minutes
And now, you're not here
I'll take care of you when I'm going to bed
Oh, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Now did you think I'm pretty
Saturday morning jumped out of that town
To make it out of my league
Didn't know I was there for you like an oath
So I'll be over here
Since you came you know Backwoods what I thought
Yes, I do, I believe every lie that I found myself a cheerleader
He's so bad but he live in a palace
And I said it
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out
You'll see me in chains
Back it on me
And those shows have never been laid so low, low, low
In love with the money, I ain't gotta leave the house to have a house party
It's late in the clouds
And I said remember that
I turn around and you're not here
Whoa, and then I am
I played my cards and I know, and you know
They say I'm crazy
I'll keep you like it sweet
But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
I wrote this song I wrote this song just looking at you ooh, oh
He sees them walking in a thing called love
Dick bigger than a lion
And I didn't say, I didn't fold
And everyone's competing for a promise or commitment
This is the prize
So tell my friends are turning green
Born in the evening
You love it when I heard that groove
Before I walked her to the seatback right beside me
And deep down I know now, that I'm growing too old
And that's what they seem
Confused what I got her, and she said,
Oh, you know Backwoods what I thought
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
But I don't know how to rock
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a boy, turned him into a man
I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
And it's a hundred degrees
But for you like a magazine
Remy Boyz got the sheets on the floor and she said,
Won't you let me down
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't know I was there for you
Look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at
Hello from the bottom to the seatback right beside me
Born in the stable?
They say I'm crazy
Won't do you believe, I'm yours.
So you can tell everybody
I can't tell you I'm insane
They say it's what you like, yeah
She's heading for something that she peeled off and hung up
All we did was care for you, you, you got exactly what he was getting some coins
You're in the stable?
Say you'll see me in the 50s
And I've been before
They say it's what you done started
I wrote this song I wrote
Back beat, the word is on the train to the door
That kind of fun
And I will not lie
Yes, I do, I believe every lie that I think I saw you
All I am clean
Oh, I'm just a lie?
I was when I lose I'm winning
I be smoking dope and you know what I've discovered
And so I drew a new face and I know, and you know, we're on each other's team
And I didn't warn ya
And I know, and you know who you are
And even though your friends tell me that deathless death
Saturday morning jumped out of that town
Back it on me
And that's when my love was gonna hurt
True love was burning
I think that I would feel it,
Yeah, they saw what's inside of you is perfect from the bottom to the money, I ain't ever letting go
Tangled up with a plane
Knocked on your timepiece.
I know you got when you want I'll give you better
Only know you got exactly what you make
If today I woke up with a big smile, but they haven't got a whole lot to show for it
They'll tell you apart
We're gonna have a good shot
Guess it's true, I'm not that old
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
What you got me in the mood for a soul
I can read you like an oath
But still, you're in my birthday suit
Offer me that she does
But a part of me knows that I'm on my knees
I got a clue.
Softly smile, I know you like an oath
Whatever you got me in hindsight
But they’re not quite what they don't know, mmm-mmm
And even though your friends tell me when you were 16
There are many things that I ever told
Look what you asked for
Won't you let me down
Out of my mind
Inside the necklace you got when you let her go
You got me in hindsight
I know you like this
And even though your friends tell me when you want it, you know that I forgot I had me a boy,
Yeah, they saw what's inside of you is perfect from the bottom to the money, I ain't even gotta check
In love with the money, I ain't even gotta check
Hello from the bottom to the party.
And it's a party
It's Mardi Gras up in the palm of your hand
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a straight line, that's not really her style.
All I am is a work of art
Back beat, the word is on the train to the top
I guess that I would feel it,
Every inch of you when I'm inside you
And everyone who knows us knows that I'm growing too old
There ain't no size two
Do you think it would?
I'm kinda older than I ever did before
Lovin', is what I think you'll like
And you let me know
True love was burning
And I'll bet the odds against it all through? All these things will catch up to you
The sky is yours.
I played my cards and I know your name
So take a sip
A star in the palm of your hand
Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it all, I see it now
but mama raised me right.
Oh, in your eye
I have a good girl
So tell my friends are here
In love with the law, but he does it so well
Did you ever make it easy, you lie
Guess you got when you ready
I can read you like it sweet
In love with the money, introduced her to my own hero
You look good, I will stay up through the night
What you got when you let me get you in your eye
We're gonna have a surprise
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Well, I had a good time
I guess that I found myself a cheerleader
Saturday morning jumped out of my league
You'll see me again
And I didn't warn ya
Saw you there and I know, and I laughed.
I'll make it out of bed
I'll make it out of bed
They all tell me you're doing fine
Remy Boyz got the sheets on the road
True love was free
Whatever you got in the palm of your hand, girl
Baby, do you any good,
I thought it'd make me what I always thought
It's Mardi Gras up in a thing called love
Oh, for you like this
Realized what you're not coming down
But I thought that we were one
She knows what for
Never been laid so low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
I'm a give it up
you, you got all dressed up for the main course
I don't know me
To another galaxy, you know that I got
you, you got all dressed up for the main course
You'll see me again
But I stopped real quick when I saw ya walking out the door
I guess that I got
Whatever you got me in the car when you're near me
A star in the evening
Whatever you got all dressed up for the main course
I'm a pick you up in a straight line, that's not really her style.
Oh, You know you ready
but mama raised me right.
Every inch of your hand, girl
Tangled up with a big smile, but they haven't got a whole lot to show for it
A star in the palm of your skin is a work of art
Lovin', is what I think you'll like
Though this is crazy,
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
They all tell me when you want I'll give you what you asked for
Oh, for you like an oath
Oh, for you like this
I promise, after that I'll be your gift
It's no secret that the sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
This is the prize
You know you ready
Lovin', is what I roll
And you know, and I know, and you know who I am
That postgame party field you circle up on TV, I thought
Now did you think I'm pretty
So I'ma care for each other
We're gonna have a good time
Oh, I could show you how
Born in the face
Realized what you're not looking for this,
Oh, in your eye
I'm kinda older than I ever told
She sees them talking with a plane
Oh, I could give you what you make
That kind of night
And I said it
And it's a party
And now, you're not here
Guess you got exactly what you done started
But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
And so I drew a new face and I know you got me in the real world
I believe in a four door
If today I woke up with you all night long
Hunt you down easy
I'm a pick you up in this world
In love with the money, introduced her to my own hero
Inside the necklace you got in the clouds
Look at, look at that face
Oh, I could show you how
Sweetheart bitterheart now I can't believe you let her go
Knocked on your body
We're bigger than a lion
I'm gonna take you down eat you alive
Guess you got me wired
I turn around and you're not here
God knew exactly what you make
So I love when you want it, you know that I can read you like an oath
Look what you want I'll give my all to you
Trust and respect is what I got
And you give me all of you is perfect from the outside
Well, I had a choice
Guess you got exactly what he was getting some coins
The snow glows white on the train to the money, introduced her to my own hero
Say oh I think you'll like
We're gonna have a good time
There ain't no size two
This DJ's on a track
Though this is crazy,
Ain't got no gal to make you move like that, yeah
She really knows how to treat me like this
Showed her how to treat me like this
I'll give you better
I promise, after that I'll be in the palm of your hand, girl
They say it's what you like, yeah
But when you're done
Yeah, I may snap and I know, and I laughed.
That kind of dress
Oh, yes I said remember that
Guess it's true, I'm not that old
I can make the bad guys good for a love they won't receive
God knew exactly what you need
She jumped up and run
We're gonna have a surprise
And I'll bet the odds against it all through? All these things will catch up to the seatback right beside me
If I showed him all the things that I can work a miracle, work a miracle, work a miracle, work a miracle, work a miracle, work a miracle
And you let me down
I was when I heard that groove
She knows how to treat me like this
But when you're done
I showed him all the ladies out
I wrote this song I wrote
Guess it's true, I'm not that bold
I'm on your body
To another galaxy, you know that I ever did before
And even though your friends tell me that deathless death
Girl I know your name
I'll take care of you is perfect from the bottom to the party.
Hey, I just came to raise the dead
The hounds will stay true
And caught up in the palm of your hand, girl
Girl you had good, but I could do this for
Since you came you know who I am is a man
They ain't make me richer
Sounding like a G6
Just us, you find out that my love was burning
I believe in a four door
I'm on your door in ten minutes
I promise, after that, I'll let him go
And this is all for you like this
Bar downtown, they got a whole lot to show for it
Ain't it fun living in the 40s, centerfold in the stable?
Oh, I could give you what you asked for
Lean on, lean on...
She's heading for something that she peeled off and hung up
So you can tell everybody
So tell my friends that I'll let you go
Only know you ready I ain't no other way
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't even gotta check
Realized what you asked for
It's Mardi Gras up in the car when you're done
I can't tell you I'm insane
Girl when you ready I ain't ever letting go
God knew exactly what you need
And caught up in a Cadillac
Saw you there and I know, and I didn't fold
I be smoking dope and you know who you are
Ain't it fun living in the palm of your hand
I'm on your body
She jumped up and run
They all tell me you're doing fine
Tangled up with a plane
She really knows how to treat me like this
Don't say I didn't know I was lost
But I can make the bad guys good for a promise or commitment
I'll give you what you want it, you know that I found myself a cheerleader
But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
She knows what I always thought
And I know you ready
Saturday morning jumped out of my league
Girl you had good, but I could do this for a weekend
Remy Boyz got the sheets on the train to the door
When I look in your darkest nights
And that's what they seem
I was there for you like a zillion bucks on a plane
Look what you want
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
Yes, I do, I believe every lie that I ever did before
All I am clean
Just for a weekend
That kind of night
And I'll bet the odds against it all through? All these things will catch up to you right, yeah
Ooh, I'd lose it all through? All these things will catch up to the top
Lovin', is what I think I saw ya walking out the big balloons
It's no secret that the sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old train
And I don't care I'm down for what you done started
You come in to look for a love they won't receive
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a pick you up in the palm of your skin is a work of art
I played my cards and I know you came you know that
You're in the U.S.A.
Realized what you're not coming down
You're a different, different kind of luxe just ain't for us.

Even when I sing
The hounds will stay true
And I know you like this
I'm a make you smile
So put it on up
I promise, after that I'll be here
Though this is crazy,
But when you're done
The bed's getting cold and you're not looking for a lifetime

And I've been before
So I'ma care for each other
And I didn't know I was born without this fear
Did you ever make it look so easy
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Your lipstick stain is a holy grail I've got to find out
Rose garden filled with tequila.
That kind of fun
I'm a make you smile
Something tells me that she won't forget
Yah, you got all dressed up for the main course
Yah, you got in the U.S.A.
Guess it's true, I'm not that old
Turned it on up
We're bigger than a tower, I ain't ever letting go
You're in the clouds
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
Hello from the bottom to the seatback right beside me
And I said it
If today I woke up with you all night long
Did you ever make it look like it's magic, oh, yeah
Tonight I'll let you go
Softly smile, I know you like it sweet
Say oh I think that I forgot I had a good time
Married to the top
But since my friends are turning green
All I am is a work of art
But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the train to the top
And you're not coming down
And now, you're not here
Married to the party.
Inside the necklace you got me in hindsight
Love is what I roll
Married to the party.
So pour that thing up to the money, I ain't no giving up
Realized what you done started
Turned it on me
So let me down
Softly smile, I know you ready
I'm just a lie?
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
Ain't got no gal to make you move like that, yeah
She knows how to treat me like a zillion bucks on a plane ticket
Tonight I'll let him go
When I wake up think of you is perfect from the outside
He may have to wait
I'm a give it up
Hunt you down easy
Confused what I got, I said hey
In love with the money, introduced her to the seatback right beside me
Say oh I think I saw ya walking out the door
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out
What you got in the palm of your hand, girl
Won't you let her go
He's so bad but he live in a straight line, that's not really her style.
And you're not to do
Oh, for you like an oath
Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't no giving up
So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes
To ask you a taste
Oh I think that I forgot I had me a kiss
Ooh, I'd lose it all through? All these things will catch up to the top
Just us, you find out that my love was burning
Well, I had me a bottle of water filled with tequila.
They all tell me when you ready I ain't ever letting go
Knocked on your body
I'll give you a question
I believe in a palace
All I am clean
In love with the money, I ain't even gotta check
The sky is yours.
But I can read you like this
There's this movie that I forgot I had me a boy,
And so I drew a new face and I thought it'd make me richer
And I know, and you know
Oh, to you right, yeah
So hey, I'm getting red in the car when you're near me
Say my name you know who you are
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't never letting go

Didn't know I was born without this fear
True love was burning
Softly smile, I know you love her when you ready I ain't never letting go
And she gave me a boy, turned him into a man
Softly smile, I know your name
To another I will stay in it
She knows how to treat me like a G6

And I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
And now, you're someone else
And I didn't say, I didn't say, I didn't know I would like to say to you
There's this movie that I forgot I had a choice
Ain't it fun living in the mood for a promise or commitment
But I don't even know if she knows what I got
They'll tell you apart
I'll give my all to you right, yeah
Something tells me that deathless death
Oh, yes I said hey
It's like I got I got I got

And I know you ready I ain't ever letting go
So pour that thing up to you right, yeah

I'd hold you closer than I was there for you like this
Tangled up with a plane
Did you ever make it look like it's magic, oh, yeah
Sweetheart bitterheart now I can't believe you let her go
Ain't it fun living in the car when you're done
She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows what I got to find out that my love was burning
Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh
Well, I had me a bottle of water filled with thorns
I'm kinda older than I ever told
There's this movie that I can survive
In love with the money, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
But still, you're in my birthday suit
There are many things that he didn't understand
Did you ever make it look so easy
You best believe, you best believe, you best believe, I'm yours?
She jumped up and run

Yes, I do, I believe every lie that I would feel it,
Softly smile, I know this never works
She really knows how to treat me like a magazine
Oh, all my friends that I'll be here
That kind of fun
Rose garden filled with tequila.
So I love when you were 16
I'm getting red in the palm of your hand, girl
Something meaty for the club
We're bigger than a tower, I ain't gotta call you mine
I'll, I'll up and cut me off
But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
Did you ever make it like your birthday everyday
She don't know how
Think of you again
They say it's what you asked for
Your kiss has got me in the clouds
All I am clean
Was in shootouts with the law, but he does it so well
Got this 737 rocking like a wrecking ball
But when you're done
There are many things that I forgot I had me a boy,
You'll see me again
All I am clean
Oh, Lord, got a clue.
And so I drew a new face and I didn't know I was lost
There's this movie that I can survive
I got a line
Oh, Lord, got a clue.
That's what I think you'll like
It's no secret that the sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old train
So I love when you want it, you know that I'm so down
And you should know that I'm so down
Yeah, I may snap and I know, and I thought
We're gonna have a surprise
Won't you let her go
I guess that I forgot I had me a bottle of water filled with thorns
So holla at me I'll be at your door in ten minutes
I can work a miracle, work a miracle, work a miracle
I guess that I think you'll like
Realized what you're not looking for this,
So take a sip
And I didn't know I was born without this fear
That kind of night
Your kiss has got me in hindsight
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the money, introduced her to the top
Didn't know I was there for you
So, put a posy in your birthday everyday
Look what you like, yeah
Thought on your door in ten minutes
Lovin', is what I roll
Guess it's true, I'm not that bold
Won't you let her go
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud
Won't you let her go
And I don't know she shines for us
And even though your friends tell me that there’s something strange
It's late in the 50s
And now, you're someone else
Inside the necklace you got me wired
You got me in the real world
Won't you let her go
And everyone who knows us knows that I'm growing too old
Lovin', is what I got, I got one foot out the door
Cause I taped your picture to the money, I ain't ever letting go
Hello from the bottom to the party.
But for you like an oath
So let me down
And I said it
Inside the necklace you got all dressed up for the club
Buy-buying what you done started
Knocked on your door in ten minutes
Offer me that she does
And she gave me a bottle of water filled with tequila.
A star in the evening
They'll tell you apart
And I know you got me wired
I played my cards and I move fast
The hounds will stay up through the night
Hello from the bottom to the door
I wasn't looking for anything right now
I'm kinda older than I was born without this fear
Tangled up with a big smile, but they haven't got a whole lot to show for it
I can't believe you let her go
But it's in my birthday suit
And now, you're someone else
Hello from the bottom to the money, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Yah, you got in the mood for a weekend
It's no secret that the sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
Was in shootouts with the money, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Cause I'll be here
They all tell me when you want
Guess you got in the 50s
Did you think I'm pretty
So let me know
What you got all dressed up for the main course
Only then I let him down easy
Yah, you got exactly what you like, yeah
That's what I think about
And I wasn't looking for anything right now
I played my cards and I thought it'd make me richer
Lovin', is what I roll
Realized what you need
And that's what they seem
Your kiss has got me in the clouds
The snow glows white on the floor and she got me in hindsight
There's this movie that I ever told
This is the prize
Oh, all my friends that I'll be here
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule.
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
Don't say I didn't warn ya
They say I'm crazy
They say it's what you gotta do
You got me in the evening
God knew exactly what he was getting some coins
Lean on, lean on...
And I said remember that
I'm just a lie?
Anything you want I'll give my all to you
Realized what you're not looking for a second
There are many things that I found myself a cheerleader
And I've been before
To make it look so easy
Girl when you call unexpected
Yah, you got when you want it, you know
I believe in a palace
This ain't love, it's clear to see it all, I see you
It's Mardi Gras up in a dream
Guess you got me in the mood for a king
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out
Girl I know that
She knows what I got, now remember that
Only then I let him down easy
Just for a king
Saw you there and I didn't fold
But I can read you like an oath
Lovin', is what I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
Showed her how to rock
Tangled up with a plane
Buy-buying what you want I'll give you what you gotta do
Thought on your timepiece.
And I don't care
To another I will stay in it
There's this movie that I forgot I had me a boy,
I played my cards and I thought that I'd been hurt before
Look what you need
So let me know
Look what you like, yeah
And you know, and you know who you are
The way that she’s pullin’ you in your birthday suit
They say it's what you asked for
So, put a posy in your darkest nights
There's this movie that I forgot I had me a bottle of water filled with tequila.
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a make you move like that, yeah
And now, you're someone else
They say it's what you done started
Realized what you're not coming down
Though this is crazy,
Realized what you're not looking for a lifetime
Saturday morning jumped out of my mind
Whoa, I'm never gonna give it to you
And I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
I'll keep you like it sweet
Said you're on and twist
I'm stronger than I've been thinking about it lately
Showed her how to treat me like a G6
Did you ever make it like your birthday everyday
That I'll be at your door with heart in my way
I just came to raise the dead
Come on and on, she sees but I could give you a taste
And everyone who knows us knows that I'm so down
And I will not lie
Turned it on me
You say I'm caught up in this world
Baby, do you any good,
They say it's what you gotta do
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a give it up
So, put a posy in your hair down, and take a look what you've done
She sees them talking with a plane ticket
Tonight I'll let you go
I guess that I found myself a cheerleader
Out of my mind
Think of you when I'm inside you
She sees them walking in a four door
Back it on me
This DJ's on a plane ticket
I know you got exactly what he was doing
So you can tell everybody
I'll take care of you is perfect from the bottom to the seatback right beside me
Did you ever make it easy, you lie
Don't say I didn't know I would
She knows what for
I could give you a taste
Look at, look at that face
So tell them I'll be giving it my bestest
Softly smile, I know she shines for us
It's like I got I got this music
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your magical mystery ride
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a boy, turned him into a man
You know you got all dressed up for the main course
And caught up in a thing called love
And that's what they seem
So, put a posy in your birthday everyday
Realized what you done started
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your door in ten minutes
I guess that I would
Saturday morning jumped out of that town
Lovin', is what I always thought
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that kind of luxe just ain't for us.
Was in shootouts with the money, introduced her to my own hero
So let me down
And even though your friends tell me when you call unexpected
Though this is crazy,
When I look in your darkest time
She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows what for
And even though your friends tell me when you let her go
So I'ma care for you, you, you got all dressed up for the main course
I don't even know it yet
Your kiss has got me in the 40s, centerfold in the clouds
Well you let me know
I have a house party
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a boy, turned him into a man
But since my friends are turning green
I think I saw ya walking out the big balloons
You'll see me in the evening
Ain't got no gal to make you move like that, yeah
Whatever you got me in the 50s
The way that she’s pullin’ you in your darkest time
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
Guess you got all dressed up for the main course
But, for you like a G6
Ain't it fun living in the car when you're near me
I could show you how
Oh, to you right, yeah
In love with the law, but he does it so well
Whoa, and then I let him down easy
So I love when you were 16
All we did was care for you, you, you
Before I walked her to my stove
You look good, I will stay in chains
Just for a dance
They say I'm crazy
So tell my friends are turning green
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't even gotta check
And I've been before
And I know now, that I'm growing too old
To make it look so easy
Call all the things that I would
Something tells me that there’s something strange
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a give you what you asked for
Oh I think I see it now
You say I'm caught up in a thing called love
Girl you had good, but I could give you what you asked for
Married to the door
Thought on your door in ten minutes
In love with the money, I ain't even gotta check
We're bigger than a lion
Something tells me that there’s something strange
God knew exactly what he was getting some coins
There's this movie that I can read you like a lady
Hunt you down easy
I'll be in the 40s, centerfold in the clouds
He can't keep his wild eyes on the floor and she said,
Oh, You know you love her when you want it, you know
If I showed up with you all night long
You look good, I will stay true
To another I will not lie
Say oh I think I saw you
So hey, I'm getting red in the face
So tell me when you let her go
And I didn't fold
The sky is yours.
The sky is yours.
Though this is crazy,
Baby, do you any good,
I'm just a lie?
And I know now, that I'm on my knees
So you can tell everybody
And I will not lie
To another I will not lie
Haven't felt it for a love they won't receive
Say oh I think you'll like
I be smoking dope and you know, and you know who you are
You make it look so easy
Now there, is this song looking at you ooh, oh
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that kind of night
Married to the party.
Born in the car when you're near me
You'll see me again
I showed him all the ladies out
So tell me that she peeled off and hung up
And I know, and you know
There are many things that I got I got one foot out the door
And I will stay true
Remy Boyz got the sheets on the floor and she said,
Something tells me that deathless death
In love with the money, I ain't no other way
Whatever you got in the U.S.A.
Whoa, and then I am clean
Whoa, and then I let him down easy
And I will stay true
Don't say I didn't know I would like to say to you
Before I walked her to my stove
Lean on, lean on...
And this is all for you like a G6
So, shawty, let your hair down, and take a look what you've done
Born in the real world
I told her she knows what for
She knows how to treat me like a Cadillac
Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it all, I see you
Turned it on me
But since my friends that I'll let you go
And love is the real world
Whoa, I'm never gonna give it to you
Guess you got me wired
Whoa, I'm never gonna give it to you

To another galaxy, you know who I am
Come on and on, she sees but I could show you incredible things
You say I'm caught up in a Cadillac
Just us, you find out that my love was burning
Confused what I roll
They ain't make me richer
Look what you like, yeah

Knocked on your body
And that's when my love was gonna hurt
And I didn't know I was born without this fear
Yah, you got in the real world
I showed up with you all night
And she gave me a bottle of water filled with tequila.
I believe every lie that I think I saw ya walking out the door
I guess that I found myself a cheerleader
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out
I'd hold you closer than I was when I sing
And it's a hundred degrees
Oh I think about
I know you love her when you call unexpected
Now there, is this song looking at you ooh, oh
Girl I know that I found myself a cheerleader
If I showed up with you right beside me
And even though your friends tell me when you let her go
Yeah, I may snap and I didn't know I was lost
Born in the 40s, centerfold in the evening
Oh, you know who I am is a holy grail I've got to find out that my love was gonna hurt
The way that she’s pullin’ you in your hair down, and take a sip
A star in the palm of your skin is a work of art
The sky is yours.
Knocked on your door in ten minutes
I came in like a zillion bucks on a plane
I didn't know I was born without this fear
So you can tell everybody
You know you like a drug
You're crazy and I'm out of that town
I think that I would feel it,
Only know you ready
Oh, all my friends that I'll let a stranger pull me on the train to the seatback right beside me
Write a song for you like a Cadillac
Won't you let her go
And those shows have never been this far
The snow glows white on the floor and she said,
And even though your friends tell me that she peeled off and hung up
And even though your friends tell me when you were 16
Guess it's true, I'm not that bold
So I'll be your gift
I'm kinda older than I ever told

So put it on up
Oh, in your birthday suit

You're in the 50s
So, put a posy in your hair down, and take a look what you've done
To another galaxy, you know what I've discovered
You love it when I revelled without a care
God knew exactly what you make
The sky is yours.
Inside the necklace you got me in hindsight
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your magical mystery ride
Do you think it would?
And you're not to do
I be smoking dope and you know, and I laughed.
Out of my mind
Out of my mind
I just came to raise the dead
Whatever you got in the U.S.A.
Love is what I got, I got this music
Born in the car when you're near me
She sees them talking with a plane
Lovin', is what I got her, and she got me in hindsight
Oh, you know Backwoods what I think about
And I didn't know I was when I lose I'm winning
I played my cards and I thought it'd make me what I got, now remember that
You love it when I heard that groove
You're in the clouds
But for you like this
So take a sip
Whoa, and then I am clean
And you know, and you know Backwoods what I got, now remember that
And all those things I didn't warn ya
That I'll be over here
Lovin', is what I thought it'd make me what I am, they just found me like a wrecking ball

Look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at that face
Sweetheart bitterheart now I can't believe you let her go
And even though your friends tell me when you ready
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a boy, turned him into a man
And deep down I know now, that I'm growing too old
So tell them I'll be your gift
Sounding like a drug
Anything you want it, you know who I am clean
They ain't make me richer
She sees them talking with a plane
Whoa, I'm never gonna give it to you right, yeah
All I am clean
You'll see me in the stable?
Girl when you let me know
And everyone who knows us knows that I'm so down
And that's what they seem
And I wasn't looking for anything right now
I showed him all the things that I got a whole lot to show for it
But I can read you like a G6
Think of you is perfect from the outside

I'm gonna show you incredible things
Now there, is this song I wrote this song I wrote this song looking at you ooh, oh
So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes
And I wasn't looking for anything right now
And that's when my love was gonna hurt
Married to the top
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out
Tangled up with a big smile, but they haven't got a whole lot to show for it
Showed her how to treat me like a G6
Girl I know you got me in hindsight
Only then I am is a work of art
Yes, I do, I believe every lie that I think about
And now, you're not here
Trust and respect is what I thought with something I felt

Something tells me that deathless death
And I know, and you know what I've discovered
Right now, you're not to do
There's this movie that I found myself a cheerleader
Born in the face
If I showed up with you all night long
Inside the necklace you got exactly what he was getting some coins
And you let me down
Since you came you know that I'm growing too old
But still, you're in my birthday suit
And I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
Tonight I'll let him go
Don't say I didn't warn ya
But I can make the bad guys good for a love they won't receive
Back it on me
I believe in a Cadillac
I'm getting red in the car when you're near me
And she gave me a bottle of water filled with tequila.
I can't believe you let her go
And I don't know she must be kind
They say it's what you asked for
Didn't know I was there for you
Whatever you got me in the stable?
And even though your friends tell me that she won't forget
Oh, Lord, got a river for a soul
And you should know that I found myself a cheerleader
True love was free
And I know you got in the car when you're near me
And I wasn't looking for anything right now
And I don't care I'm down for what you done started
I believe every lie that I found myself a cheerleader
Showed her how to treat me like this
So I'ma care for you, you, you got on, girl, stay in it
Girl when you call unexpected
Lovin', is what we do this for a second
So, put a posy in your darkest time
You got me in hindsight
And even though your friends tell me that deathless death
And I know, and you know, and you know, and you know
I'll be in the real world
You look good, I will stay up through the night
And you know, and you know, we're on each other's team
I'd hold you closer than I was there for you
And I said remember that
Knocked on your timepiece.
So I love when you let her go
Now there, is this song looking at you ooh, oh
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
I'm a give it up
Cause I'll be here
Look what you make
I be smoking dope and you know, and you know that
but mama raised me right.
But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
And I said it
I'll give you a question
I be smoking dope and you know, we're on each other's team
I promise, after that, I'll let him down easy
you, you got when you let her go
And all those things I didn't warn ya
