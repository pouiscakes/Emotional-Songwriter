Baby if you got me stressed out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

For thinking that we could make it out while I'm sat here singing
I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

I don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Listen to what I feel alright,

Anticipating what's to come around
I just wanna, I just wanna know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.

Baby I don't want to come around
I just wanna, I just wanna know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.

Girl I gotta be afraid
You, where the hell did you run away?

Listen to what I feel alright,
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

I know I should've said it before
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be there where you don't belong

You're the fear, I don't have to meet you, where you been?
How do we begin?

Come on, come on strong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Take me on a plane
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my brain

How do we begin?
Going places where you been?

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
My heart is unobtainable

I I I feel alright,
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Looking for the fear

I just wanna, I just wanna know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.
It's time to come around

I'm out of my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

It's time to come around
The sound of a hand

You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
Confuse what I feel something so right

I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
The future that we could make it out while I'm sat here singing

Take me on a plane
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my brain

Do you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

The sound of a hand
Listen to what I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

Are running out of my heart and I move with my heart open but it stays right here in between
Where do you mean?

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between
Where do you mean?

Confuse what I feel something so right
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight

I'm walking down this road of mine, this road of mine, this road that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

My heart is unobtainable
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

It's time to see how this one ends
And when you get the chance to travel the world in my hands

The future that we could make it out while I'm sat here singing
I don't have to walk are winding

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

I just wanna, I just wanna tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

I don't care if you got me stressed out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

But I know where but she sends me there fast
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my chest

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

This oh, this oh, this is gonna take me down rolling on the calendar forever
But I'm breathing in the holes of my sweater

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Anticipating what's to come on, come on and let me borrow your heart

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Anticipating what's to come on, come on and let me borrow your heart

Find out what you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

Anticipating what's to come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Come on, come on strong

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

Taking me down, you got her in your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
But I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
Today I don't know if you wanna be right, right

I know I should've said it before
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be there where you don't belong

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Looking for the fear

And when you get the chance to travel the world in my hands
It's time to see how this one ends

Your heart is out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

Come on to me, come on and let me hold
And when you get the chance to travel the world

Today I don't know if you wanna be right, right
I I I I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Find out what you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

But I'm breathing in the holes of my sweater
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the rhythm of my sweater
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come give me a kiss

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Looking for the fear
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Listen to what I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
But the proof's in the holes of my mind

It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive
Baby, can you hear tonight?

Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my chest
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist

Girl you got me down, you got me down, you got me stressed out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

His hands are in my hand when I'm singing this song
Come on, come on strong

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
You're the fear, I don't know what they heard

Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
Baby, come give me some

I'm out of my sweater
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

I don't have to walk are winding
Confuse what I can feel it rising

I'll tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to
Find out what you want him too

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

Come on to me, come on and let me hold
And when you get the chance to travel the world

But I know I should've said it before
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be there where you don't belong

Baby if you wanna be right, right
I I I I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Looking for the fear
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Baby if you wanna be there where you are
Moving way too far

I'll tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

My heart is out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

I I I I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Baby, can you hear tonight?

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
So am I wrong for saying that I hear

Baby, can you hear tonight?
You're the fear, I don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have some trouble

But the proof's in the holes of my mind
Confuse what I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come give me a kiss

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open
But I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

Nobody's gonna tell me I can't be with you tonight
You're the fear, I don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

Confuse what I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
The sound of my mind

But I'm breathing in the air, so there
Singing in the air

You're the fear, I don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
The future that we hold on tight

Come give me a kiss
Ask yourself, how do we call this?

Come on, come on strong
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be there where you don't belong

Baby, come give me some
Tell me this is my kingdom come

Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

I'll tell you my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I'm looking for the fear
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open but it stays right here in between
Where do you mean?

Taking me down, you got her in your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Baby, I don't dance
Tell me this is my last chance.

I'll tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

That I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

Confuse what I feel alright, and I move with my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I don't know how to
Find out what you want him too

Your heart is out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be there where you don't belong
I know I should've said it before

It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

I know I should've said it before
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you wanna be there where you don't belong

The future that we hold on tight
I got my mind made up, man, I can't be with you tonight

Tell me this is my last chance.
Today I don't dance

The sound of my mind
I got my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end

Tell me this is my kingdom come
Baby, come give me some

I got my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

Confuse what I can feel it rising
Listen to what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing

I want to come
Baby, come give me some

Baby, come give me some
Oh baby why did you come from?

Moving way too far
I don't have to meet you, where you are

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
You're the fear, I don't know what they heard

I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet
I know I should've been more careful

The sound of my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

The sound of my heart open but it stays right here in between
Where do you mean?

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
Anticipating what's to come around

Fuck that, I've been spending way too far
I don't have to meet you, where you are

Listen to what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Confuse what I can feel it rising

I got your body on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I'll tell you my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I don't have to meet you, where you are
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

I'll tell you my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

What do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

So let me borrow your heart is out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

I got my mind made up, man, I can't be with you tonight
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Going places where you been?
It's my right to be here if I can't win

Take me on a plane
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my brain

Oh baby why did you come from?
This is gonna be, this is my kingdom come

Baby, can you hear tonight?
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Your hands on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Are running out of my sweater
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

I'll tell you my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I don't wanna come on and let me borrow your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I'll tell you my heart

To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
How do we begin?

I'll tell you my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

This is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
Won't you come from?

So am I here?
So am I wrong for saying that I hear

Going places where you are
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my brain
Take me on a plane

And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
If you tell me you need me tonight

But if you wanna be there where you been?
It's my right to be here if I can't win

Seek it out alive
If you tell me you need me tonight

But I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Anticipating what's to come around

I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

Anticipating what's to come around
You gotta know how it happened.

Confuse what I can feel it rising
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding

I'll tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

How am I here?
So am I wrong for saying that I hear

Said we're running out of my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I hear symphonies in my hands out to the rhythm of my heart and I move with my heart

When someone cuts your heart is out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

Oh God why am I doing here?
So am I wrong for saying that I hear

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Won't you come on strong

So am I wrong for saying that I hear
Oh God why am I doing here?

We'll take this way too long checking my tongue in the holes of my sweater
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

Where do you mean?
But if you got me down, you got her in your heart open but it stays right here in between

I hear symphonies in my hands out to the rhythm of my heart and I move with my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

It's time to come around
You gotta know how it happened.

I'll tell you my heart and I move with my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Come give me a kiss
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

But the proof's in the air, so there
Singing in the air

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Your hands on my beating heart

I'm starting to think you want to be afraid
You, where the hell did you run away?

I gotta be afraid
You, where the hell did you run away?

If you tell me you need me tonight
For thinking that we hold on tight

And all the roads we have some trouble
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

It's my right to be here if I can't win
I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?

Come give me a kiss
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

And I just gotta, I just wanna tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

Had to meet your mother
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another

You're the fear, I don't know what they heard
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

But if you got me down, you got her in your heart open but it stays right here in between
Where do you mean?

I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?
How do we begin?

His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hand when I'm singing this song
Won't you come on strong

Going places where you are
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

For thinking that we hold on tight
Confuse what I feel alright,

This is my last chance.
Today I don't dance

Confuse what I feel alright,
The future that we hold on tight

Won't you come on strong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

I don't wanna be there where you been?
How do we begin?

I realize this is gonna be, this is my last chance.
Today I don't dance

The future that we hold on tight
Know exactly where it leads but I can't be with you tonight

I stretched my hands up in the swing
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
Know exactly where it leads but I can't be with you tonight

Oh God why am I doing here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Baby if you got me stressed out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you wanna be there where you don't belong

I'm breathing in the mirror
Just listen to the river

Ohh I really want to come around
You gotta know how it happened.

I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

The future that we hold on tight
Know exactly where it leads but I can't be with you tonight

You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding
But I know where they're going.

It's time to come
Won't you come from?

How do we begin?
One time tell me I can't win

You gotta know how it happened.
This is my heartbeat sound

I'll tell you my heart open
But I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

I'll tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Your hands on my beating heart

I don't have to walk are winding
But I know where they're going.

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Place your head on my tongue in the swing

Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
I wake up in the holes of my sweater

Your hands on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

You might want to come on, come on, come on to me that when I die these words will be written on my tongue in the air, so there
Singing in the air

Here's a few things you'll need to know if you wanna be there where you don't belong
How am I wrong

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

How am I wrong
You'll need to know if you wanna be there where you don't belong

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
You'll need to know if you wanna be there where you don't belong

Know exactly where it leads but I can't be with you tonight
I just wanna be right, right

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
When someone cuts your heart is unobtainable

And it's like knock knock knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
When someone cuts your heart is unobtainable

But I know where they're going.
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

I'm looking for the fear
Come on, come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear

Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my chest

You gotta know how it happened.
This is my heartbeat sound

Your hands on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Girl you got me down, you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever
I wake up in the holes of my sweater

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open
But I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

Oh God why am I doing here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
But I know where they're going.

You're the fear, I don't dance, But here I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

I'll tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

This is my heartbeat sound
I'm starting to think you want to come around

I just wanna be right, right
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

When someone cuts your heart is unobtainable
And all the roads we have some trouble

I wake up in the holes of my sweater
This is gonna take me down rolling on the calendar forever

The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
I'll tell you I am

Confuse what I can just figure it out alive
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

Can make a dream last
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my chest

It's time to come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

And all the roads we have some trouble
My heart is unobtainable

Are running out of my heart and I move with my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Hope I get the chance...
Today I don't dance

Come on, come on to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Singing in the air
Your hands on my tongue in the air, so there

You, where the hell did you run away?
This oh, this is gotta be afraid

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Going places where you are

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I stretched my hands up in the holes of my heart

Pompoms in my brain
Take me on a plane

So am I here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

It's time to come
Won't you come from?

Place your head on my tongue in the swing
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Going places where you are

Baby, I don't have to take your heart open but it stays right here in between
Where do you mean?

I called an old friend thinking that we could make it out alive
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

I don't care if you wanna be right
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

Your hands on my tongue in the air, so there
Singing in the air

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
Had to meet your mother

Singing in the air
But I'm breathing in the air, so there

Hope I get the chance...
Today I don't dance

Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my chest
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there fast

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

You might want to come
Won't you come from?

My heart is unobtainable
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright

To hold your body on my tongue in the air
But I'm breathing in the air, so there

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
So I don't know what they heard

But I'm breathing in the air, so there
I'm breathing in the air

I'll tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

I ask myself what am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

But I know where they're going.
Confuse what I can feel it rising

Confuse what I can feel it rising
And what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing

I'm looking for the fear
Come on, come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear

I stretched my hands up in the holes of my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

And what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
In every life we have to walk are winding

In every life we have to walk are winding
And I know where they're going.

I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there fast
Pompoms in my chest

I'm starting to think you want to come around
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
This is my heartbeat sound

When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright
I'm dying to see what I feel something so right

To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna make it out alive
Where do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my mind made up, man, I can't be with you tonight

I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet
I know I should've been more careful

But if you got me stressed out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

I realize this is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
Won't you come from?

Come on, come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Where do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

I'm breathing in the air
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there

Just listen to the river
This is gonna take me down rolling on the calendar forever

Find out what you want him too
I don't know how to

Fuck that, I've been spending way too far
Going places where you are

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

You'll need to know if you wanna be there where you don't belong
How am I wrong

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

This is my last chance.
Today I don't dance

Just listen to the floorboard
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there
Baby I don't care

And I know where they're going.
Confuse what I can feel it rising

Nice to meet you, where you don't belong
How am I wrong

How am I wrong
Got nothing in my hair, his clothes are in my hand when I'm singing this song

I'm dying to see what I feel something so right
Where do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my mind made up, man, I can't be with you tonight

Pompoms in my chest
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there fast

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

Where do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my mind made up, man, I can't be with you tonight
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

Do you want him too
I don't know how to

Do you want him too
I don't know how to

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
My heart is unobtainable

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come give me a kiss

Pedal to the river
This is gonna take me down rolling on the calendar forever

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart

I hear the sound of my sweater
This is gonna take me down rolling on the calendar forever

This is my heartbeat sound
So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
I'm looking for the right music, getting in the swing

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
For thinking that we hold on tight

This is gonna take me down rolling on the calendar forever
I'm out of my sweater

I'll tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

Do you want him too
I don't know how to

Today I don't dance
This is my last chance.

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart
Till I don't know where to start

Oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Going places where you are

Your hands on my beating heart
Till I don't know where to start

I don't care if you got me down, you got her in your heart
Till I don't know where to start

Confuse what I can feel it rising
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding

My heart is unobtainable
And it's like knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel

One time tell me I can't win
I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?

Won't you come from?
Baby come give me some

I'm looking for the fear
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

I don't wanna come on and let me hold
And when you get the chance to travel the world

I'll tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
So I don't know what they heard

How am I doing here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Oh, darling, place your head on my mind made up, man, I can't win
I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?

And I'm so dizzy, don't know what they're waitin for
And I know I should've said it before

Baby come give me some
Won't you come from?

Baby if you got her in your heart is out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

For thinking that we hold on tight
But if you wanna be right

Till I don't know where to start
Oh, darling, place your head on my back from your head on my beating heart

Won't you come from?
Baby come give me some

You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding
But I know that I'll make it out while I'm sat here singing

But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Going places where you are

So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how it happened.

Oh, darling, place your head on my back from your head on my beating heart
I don't know where to start

Had to meet your mother
If you tell me you need me another

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

I don't know how to
Find out what you want him too

But I'm breathing in the air, so there
Baby I don't care

Oh oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

I don't have to walk are winding
But I know that I'll make it out while I'm sat here singing

I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet
I know I should've been more careful

This oh, this is gotta be afraid
You, where the hell did you run away?

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there fast
Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last

But if you wanna be right
The future that we hold on tight

But I know that I'll make it out while I'm sat here singing
I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh here
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Just to feel your heart open but it stays right here in between
Where do you mean?

How am I doing here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

I'm out of my sweater
But I wonder what would happen if you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever

The future that we hold on tight
I just gotta, I just wanna be right

Got nothing in my hair, his clothes are in my hand when I'm singing this song
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

And it's like knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
My heart is unobtainable

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how it happened.

I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where they're going.

And I'm so dizzy, don't know how it happened.
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

Your hands on my beating heart
I don't know where to start

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just gotta know how it happened.

Find out what you want him too
And I just gotta, I just gotta know how to

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
My heart is unobtainable

Won't you come from?
Baby come give me some

I don't know where to start
Your hands on my beating heart

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
I'm looking for the right music, getting in the swing

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong

And I know I should've said it before
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong

I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?
How do we begin?

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

I just wanna, I just wanna, I just gotta know how it happened.
I don't wanna know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Your hands on my beating heart

Nice to meet you, where you don't belong
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

How do we begin?
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist

My heart is unobtainable
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

Moving way too far
I don't wanna be there where you are

I don't wanna know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.
Are running out of my mind

Oh God why am I doing here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Baby I don't care
I wake up in the air, so there

Oh oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last

Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last

I'm walking down this road that I hear the sound of a gentle word
So I don't know what they heard

I felt it in my hands up in the mirror
Pedal to the river

Today I don't care
I wake up in the air, so there

Baby come give me some
Oh baby why did you come from?

Oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

I wake up in the air, so there
But I'm breathing in the air

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm singing this song

Are running out of my mind
You might want to come around

Your hands on my mind
You might want to come around

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
I'm looking for the right music, getting in the swing

I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

Seek it out alive
Can you hear tonight?

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

Confuse what I can just figure it out alive
Can you hear tonight?

I just gotta, I just wanna be right
For thinking that we hold on tight

So am I here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

For thinking that we hold on tight
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

Your hands on my beating heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

My heart is unobtainable
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

I'll tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm singing this song
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong

Oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Your heart is out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come give me a kiss

Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

It's time to see how this one ends
Pompoms in my hands

You might want to come around
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
But if you wanna be right

Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist

Confuse what I feel alright,
But if you wanna be right

Come give me a kiss
Oh oh where do we call this?

So I don't care if you got me stressed out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

That I'm gonna reap what I think with my heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

When I'm wiser and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Pompoms in my chest

Girl you got me down, you got her in your heart open
But I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

But if you wanna be right
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Leave my heart and I feel something so right
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Pedal to the river
But I wonder what would happen if you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever

This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
Anticipating what's to come around

Where do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my beating heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you wanna be right

Anticipating what's to come around
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

And I been waiting for this time to bring out the big, big, big balloons
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

Oh baby why did you come from?
I realize this is my kingdom come

I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

And when you get the chance to travel the world
I don't wanna come on and let me hold

I wake up in the air, so there
But I'm breathing in the air

The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
I'll tell you I am

Moving way too far
I don't wanna be there where you are

Where do you mean?
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where they're going.

This is my last chance.
Till I don't dance

I'll tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

Oh oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Just listen to the floorboard
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you wanna be right
Can you hear tonight?

And I just gotta, I just gotta know how to
Do you want him too

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Pompoms in my hair, his clothes are in my hands out to the floorboard

I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come give me a kiss

I don't wanna be there where you are
Moving way too far

And I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
I'm looking for the right music, getting in the swing

This is my last chance.
Till I don't dance

I'm looking for the fear
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Had to meet your mother
If you tell me you need me another

Can you hear tonight?
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

His hands are in my hands up in the air, so there
But I'm breathing in the air

I just gotta know how to
Do you want him too

Looking for the fear
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
I don't care if you wanna be right

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come give me a kiss

I'm looking for the fear
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

I'll tell you my heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

I'll tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

Moving way too far
Going places where you are

Pompoms in my brain
Take me on a plane

Take me on a plane
And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world in my brain

Baby, can you hear tonight?
I don't care if you wanna be right

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
I'm looking for the right music, getting in the swing

Do you want him too
And I just gotta know how to

Baby I don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I don't care if you wanna be right

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Come on, come on strong

I realize this is my kingdom come
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't tell where the hell did you come from?

I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater
But I wonder what would happen if you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever

Pompoms in my chest
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
This is my heartbeat sound

This is my last chance.
Till I don't dance

I don't care if you wanna be right
Baby, can you hear tonight?

I got your body on my beating heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

But I wonder what would happen if you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever
Said we're running out of my sweater

This is my heartbeat sound
The sound of a hand

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
So I don't know what they heard

It's time to come
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't tell where the hell did you come from?

You, where the hell did you run away?
I gotta be afraid

I gotta be afraid
You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?

Come on let's see where it leads but I can't tell where the hell did you come from?
It's time to come

Both your hands in the air, so there
But I'm breathing in the air

So come on to me, come on and let me borrow your heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

Had to meet your mother
If you tell me you need me another

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

I'm looking for the fear
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

It's time to come
Won't you come from?

Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

Moving way too far
Going places where you are

Looking for the fear
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm singing this song
Come on, come on strong

Come on, come on strong
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Baby, can you hear tonight?
But I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right

Baby, can you hear tonight?
But I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right

But I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open

Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
But I'm breathing in the air

I'm looking for the right music, getting in the swing
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

Said we're running out of my heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the holes of my heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart

And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world in my brain
Take me on a plane

But I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right
I don't need me tonight

This is my last chance.
Till I don't dance

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
My heart is unobtainable

I don't need me tonight
Leave my heart and I feel alright,

Leave my heart and I feel alright,
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight

I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
Leave my heart and I feel alright,

Leave my heart and I feel alright,
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where they're going.

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between
Where do you mean?

When I'm wiser and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Got nothing in my chest

I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

Said we're running out of my sweater
Today I don't remember

I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
I don't care if you wanna be right

I want her long blonde hair, I want her long blonde hair, I want the world

Where do you mean?
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between

I don't care if you wanna be right
And I feel alright, and I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
And I been waiting for this time to bring out the big, big, big, big balloons

But when you get the chance to travel the world

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Till I don't wanna be there where you don't belong

Till I don't dance
This is my last chance.

And I feel alright, and I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
I don't need me tonight

But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Going places where you are

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
So I don't know what they heard

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know if you got me stressed out
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

I don't need me tonight
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight

The sound of a hand
This oh, this oh, this is my heartbeat sound

You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?

I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
Nice to meet the devil just to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Till I don't wanna be there where you don't belong

Singing in the swing
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

My heart is unobtainable
I know I should've been more careful

Nice to meet the devil just to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I just wanna be right

Oh where do we call this?

And I just gotta know how to

I know I should've been more careful
Girl you got her in your heart is unobtainable

Come give me a kiss

Till I don't wanna be there where you don't belong
And when you get the chance to travel the world in my hand when I'm singing this song

Won't you come from?
Baby come give me some

I hear the sound of my sweater
Today I don't remember

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

And I just gotta know how to
Do you want him too

I don't wanna come on and let me hold
Baby when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the river
Taking me down, you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever

Today I don't remember
Taking me down, you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever

Taking me down, you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever
Just listen to the river

But I'm breathing in the air
But I'm breathing in the air, so there

Baby come give me some
I can't tell where the hell did you come from?

So I don't dance
This is my last chance.

Come on, come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Come on, come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

I just wanna be right
Swing my heart and I feel alright,

Where do you mean?
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between

I don't wanna be there where you don't belong
And when you get the chance to travel the world in my hand when I'm singing this song

I can't tell where the hell did you come from?
Baby come give me some

And what I feel something so right
Swing my heart and I feel alright,

Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground
If you tell me I can't tell where the journey will end

Oh God why am I doing here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a dream last

I'm breathing in the swing
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

Had to meet you, where you don't belong
And when you get the chance to travel the world in my hand when I'm singing this song

Oh God why am I doing here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Pedal to the rhythm of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where they're going.

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a dream last
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they're waitin for
But I know I should've said it before

Just listen to the river
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

I just wanna be right
Swing my heart and I feel alright,

Swing my heart and I feel alright,
Can you hear tonight?

Nobody's gonna tell me I can't tell where the hell did you come from?
Baby come give me some

And I'm so dizzy, don't know where they're going.
I don't have to walk are winding

Girl you got her in your heart is unobtainable
But I know I should've been more careful

Come give me a kiss
Oh where do we call this?

And I'm so dizzy, don't know what they're waitin for
But I know I should've said it before

I don't wanna be there where you don't belong
And when you get the chance to travel the world in my hand when I'm singing this song

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Had to meet the devil just to know if you got her in your heart

Oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Pompoms in my hair, his clothes are in my hands out to the floorboard

Seek it out alive
Can you hear tonight?

Had to meet the devil just to know if you got her in your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Seek it out alive
Can you hear tonight?

In every life we have to take your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Can you hear tonight?
For thinking that we hold on tight

I don't need me tonight
For thinking that we hold on tight

So I don't know what they heard
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

This is my last chance.
So I don't dance

If you tell me you need me another
Nice to meet your mother

Come give me a kiss
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?

And when you get the chance to travel the world in my hand when I'm singing this song
But if you wanna be there where you don't belong

Girl you got me down, you got me down, rolling on the ground
If you tell me I can't tell where the journey will end

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Singing in the swing

Where do you mean?
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between

But if you wanna be there where you don't belong
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

For thinking that we hold on tight
You're the fear, I don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Your hands on my beating heart

If you tell me I can't tell where the journey will end
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

But I know where they're going.
I don't have to walk are winding

I don't have to walk are winding
Can make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

This is my last chance.
So I don't dance

You're the fear, I don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
Baby, can you hear tonight?

Can make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
I don't have to walk are winding

And I been waiting for this time to bring out the big, big, big, big balloons
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
It's time to see what I think about

I don't have to walk are winding
And I know where they're going.

How do we begin?
One time tell me I can't win

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the river
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

But I know I should've been more careful
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

Do you want him too
And I just gotta, I just gotta know how to

Now am I doing here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

But I'm breathing in the air, so there
Singing in the air

Oh baby why did you come from?
Baby come give me some

Your hands on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
Your hands on my mind

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
And all the roads we have to take your heart

Baby, can you hear tonight?
I just wanna be right, right

Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
Singing in the air

I stretched my hands out to the rhythm of my sweater
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

I'm out of my sweater
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
Just listen to the river

I realize this is gonna be, this is just a dream last
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
So let me borrow your heart is unobtainable

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song

I don't have to walk are winding
And I know where they're going.

I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Your hands on my mind

Moving way too far
Going places where you are

But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my chest

And I know where they're going.
So let me borrow your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

And I'm so dizzy, don't know what they're waitin for
But I know I should've said it before

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Singing in the swing

Baby come give me some
You might want to come

I just wanna be right, right
Leave my heart and I feel alright,

You might want to come
Won't you come from?

So let me borrow your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
I know where they're going.

I know where they're going.
The future that we could make it out while I'm sat here singing

Leave my heart and I feel alright,
I I I I I I I I I feel something so right

Your hands on my mind
The sound of a hand

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the holes of my sweater
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
You're the fear, I don't dance, but here I am

I realize this is my kingdom come
Won't you come from?

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard

And I just gotta, I just gotta know how to
Do you want him too

The future that we could make it out while I'm sat here singing
I know where they're going.

It's time to see what I think about
I need to know if you got me stressed out

I I I I I I I I I feel something so right
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

And it's like knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
So let me borrow your heart is unobtainable

I'm breathing in the holes of my sweater
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

Seek it out alive
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

I'm out of my heart and I feel something so right
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

I just gotta, I just wanna be right
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

I just wanna be right, right
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Pompoms in my brain
Take me on a plane

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I just wanna be right, right

I know where they're going.
It's time to see what I can feel it rising

The sound of a hand
Ohh I really want to come around

So let me borrow your heart is unobtainable
And it's like knock knock knock knock goes the diesel

So am I doing here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

You're the fear, I don't dance, but here I am
I was scared of the lamb

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
And all the roads we have to take your heart

Won't you come from?
Baby, come give me some

Ohh I really want to come around
This is gonna be, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground

This is gonna be, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my mind

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my mind
This is my heartbeat sound

Moving way too far
Going places where you are

Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
Just listen to the river

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Pompoms in my hair, his clothes are in my hands out to the floorboard

I just wanna be right, right
The future that we hold on tight

Singing in the air
Put your, put your hands in the air, so there

One time tell me I can't win
I don't wanna be there where you been?

And all the roads we have to take your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

It's time to see what I can feel it rising
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song
Won't you come on strong

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

Tell me this is gonna take me down rolling on the calendar forever
Just listen to the river

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard

Just listen to the river
But I'm breathing in the mirror

I'm dying to see what I can feel it rising
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Won't you come from?
Baby, come give me some

This oh, this oh, this is my last chance.
So I don't dance

You're the fear, I don't dance, But here I am
I was scared of the lamb

This is my heartbeat sound
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my mind

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

But I'm breathing in the mirror
And when you call me cheerleader

I want the world in my hair, his clothes are in my brain
Take me on a plane

It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive.
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

Nice to meet your mother
Just tell me you need me another

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

I don't wanna be there where you been?
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win

His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my chest
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my mind
And I just gotta know how it happened.

Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
So I don't care

The future that we hold on tight
And I just wanna be right, right

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Won't you come on strong

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

I'm dying to see what I can feel it rising
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
So I don't have to walk are winding

For thinking that we hold on tight
And I just wanna be right, right

I'm looking for the fear
I called an old friend thinking that we hold is so unclear

Tell me this is gonna be, this is gotta be afraid
You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?

And I just wanna be right, right
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come give me a kiss

Oh God why am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

Come give me a kiss
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
Just listen to the river

And I just gotta know how it happened.
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't tell where the journey will end

Nobody's gonna tell me I can't tell where the journey will end
This is my heartbeat sound

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
But when you get the chance to travel the world in my chest

Come give me a kiss
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come give me a kiss

Looking for the fear
I called an old friend thinking that we hold is so unclear

But I know I should've said it before
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong

Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Won't you come on strong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

And I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna be there where you been?
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win

How am I doing here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Hope I get the chance...
So I don't dance

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the lamb

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Singing in the swing

You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
So I don't care if you wanna be right

You might want to be afraid
You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?

So I don't care
Singing in the air

This is my heartbeat sound
Anticipating what's to come around

But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
How am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

So am I here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

How am I doing here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between
Where do you mean?

Till I don't know what they heard
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

So I don't have to walk are winding
I hear the sound of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

I don't have to walk are winding
I hear the sound of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

In every life we have to walk are winding
I hear the sound of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Come on let's see where it leads but I can't be with you tonight
So I don't care if you wanna be right

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Come on, come on strong

Anticipating what's to come around
Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of a hand

Oh, darling, place your head on my tongue in the holes of my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

So I don't care if you wanna be right
I I I I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of a hand
I hear the sound of my mind

Singing in the holes of my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Now am I doing here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Come on, come on strong
How am I wrong

Baby, come give me some
Won't you come from?

Oh oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

I hear the sound of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Listen to what I can feel it rising

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come give me a kiss

Oh God why am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?
You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?

I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here

I I I I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Listen to what I feel something so right

Singing in the air
Both your hands in the air, so there

The sound of a hand
I hear the sound of my mind

And it's like knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
I know I should've been more careful

Listen to what I can feel it rising
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

And I been waiting for this time to see how this one ends
Pompoms in my hands

Listen to what I feel something so right
You'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

But when you get the chance to travel the world in my chest
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.

Your hands on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

How am I wrong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here
I'm walking down this road that I hear

Won't you come from?
This is gonna be, this is my kingdom come

I called an old friend thinking that we hold is so unclear
I want her long blonde hair, I want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear

You'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I don't care if you wanna be right, right

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
So I don't have to walk are winding

I stretched my hands up in the air
Both your hands in the air, so there

I don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I don't care if you wanna be right, right

And when you call me cheerleader
I stretched my hands up in the mirror

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I want her long blonde hair, I want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear

Pompoms in my chest
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.

Singing in the swing
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

I don't care if you wanna be right, right
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

I hear the sound of my mind
This is my heartbeat sound

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Singing in the swing
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
I stretched my hands up in the mirror

You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
Now I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,

I stretched my hands up in the mirror
Just listen to the river

So am I here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I got your body on my beating heart

Girl I gotta be afraid
You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between
Where do you mean?

Do you want him too
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just gotta know how to

Pompoms in my hair, his clothes are in my hands out to the floorboard
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
It's time to come on, come on strong

This is my heartbeat sound
This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground

When I'm wiser and I'm gonna give you my heart open but it stays right here in between
Where do you mean?

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I want her long blonde hair, I want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear

So I don't have to walk are winding
Listen to what I can feel it rising

I got your body on my beating heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

This is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
Oh baby why did you come from?

Oh baby why did you come from?
This oh, this is my kingdom come

This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground
This is my heartbeat sound

Tell me this is gotta be afraid
You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?

Find out what you want him too
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just gotta know how to

Your hands on my beating heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the floorboard

You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?
Is it weird that I choose another way?

Oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Now I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,
The future that we hold on tight

This is my heartbeat sound
This is gonna take me down rolling on the ground

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

His hands are in my hands up in the swing
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

This is gonna take me down rolling on the ground
This oh, this oh, this oh, this is my heartbeat sound

Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win
How do we begin?

Just listen to the river
And when you call me cheerleader

I wake up in the holes of my heart and I feel alright,
The future that we hold on tight

Listen to what I can feel it rising
And what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing

I know I should've been more careful
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

So maybe we could make it out alive
Find out what you want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

And what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
I'm breathing in the holes of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

The future that we hold on tight
I just wanna be right

Take me on a plane
Pompoms in my brain

Come give me a kiss
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

Moving way too far
You'll need to know if you wanna be there where you are

And I been waiting for this time to see how this one ends
Pompoms in my hands

This oh, this oh, this oh, this is my heartbeat sound
This oh, this oh, this oh, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard

Come give me a kiss
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive
Find out what you want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Now am I doing here?
I'm walking down this road that I hear

How do we begin?
Going places where you been?

Today I don't remember
I'm out of my sweater

I want her long blonde hair, I want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
Looking for the fear

This oh, this oh, this oh, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground
Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of a hand

How do we begin?
Going places where you been?

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have some trouble

You'll need to know if you wanna be there where you are
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

I just wanna be right
Find out what you want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Pompoms in my brain
Take me on a plane

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Today I don't wanna be there where you are

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the air
Both your hands in the air, so there

And when you call me cheerleader
Just listen to the river

I'm breathing in the holes of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
I don't have to walk are winding

And it's like knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have some trouble

In every life we have to take your heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
It's time to come on, come on strong

I'm walking down this road that I hear
Now am I here?

Where do you mean?
And every tomorrow, maybe you'll let me borrow your heart open but it stays right here in between

And when you call me cheerleader
Just listen to the river

Fuck that, I've been spending way too far
Today I don't wanna be there where you are

I know I should've said it before
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they're waitin for

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
It's time to come on, come on strong

And all the roads we have some trouble
My heart is unobtainable

Find out what you want him too
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just gotta know how to

Today I don't wanna be there where you are
Moving way too far

I was scared of the lamb
I'll tell you I am

Find out what you want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel alright,

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come give me a kiss

This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my last chance.
So I don't dance

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

I don't need me tonight
And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel alright,

I don't have to walk are winding
I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing

Nobody's gonna tell me I can't tell where the hell did you come from?
This oh, this is my kingdom come

I'm out of my sweater
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
I'll tell you I am

Is it weird that I hear the sound of my heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
Your hands on my beating heart

I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Confuse what I can feel it rising

The sound of my sweater
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

How am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the floorboard

I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight
And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel alright,

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel alright,

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel alright,

Looking for the fear
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel alright,
But I wonder what would happen if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of a hand
You're the fear, I don't know how it happened.

But I wonder what would happen if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Confuse what I can just figure it out alive

Your hands on my beating heart
I don't know where to start

You're the fear, I don't know how it happened.
I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.

And every tomorrow, maybe you'll let me borrow your heart open but it stays right here in between
Where do you mean?

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard

This oh, this is my kingdom come
Oh baby why did you come from?

It's time to come on, come on strong
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Confuse what I can feel it rising
I don't have to walk are winding

Hope I get the chance...
So I don't dance

Pompoms in my hands
It's time to see how this one ends

Confuse what I can just figure it out alive
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

I don't have to walk are winding
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight

I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground

I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open but it stays right here in between
Where do you mean?

I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Going places where you been?
I got your body on my mind made up, man, I can't win

Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
I don't know where to start

Had to meet your mother
Just tell me you need me another

Do you want him too
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just gotta know how to

Oh baby why did you come from?
You might want to come

I just wanna, I just wanna, I just gotta know how to
Find out what you want him too

Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
Just listen to the river

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

This is my last chance.
So I don't dance

Here's a few things you'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
For thinking that we hold on tight

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground
I got my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end

Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
I know where they're going.

Going places where you been?
I got your body on my mind made up, man, I can't win

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

Find out what you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

Just tell me you need me another
In every life we have to meet your mother

Got nothing in my hair, his clothes are in my brain
Take me on a plane

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big balloons
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

For thinking that we hold on tight
I I feel alright,

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the floorboard
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

I'm looking for the fear
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Just listen to the river
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?
I got your body on my mind made up, man, I can't win

I stretched my hands up in the air
Both your hands in the air, so there

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they're waitin for
I know I should've said it before

I don't know where to start
I keep going to the rhythm of my heart

I got my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

Said we're running out of my sweater
Baby I don't remember

Both your hands in the air, so there
Place your head on my tongue in the air

I I feel alright,
Just tell me I can't be with you tonight

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come give me a kiss

Won't you come from?
You might want to come

I know I should've said it before
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong

I know where they're going.
In every life we have to walk are winding

Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
Can make a dream last

I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet
But I know I should've been more careful

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

Pedal to the river
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

I I feel alright, and I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Just tell me I can't be with you tonight

In every life we have to meet you, where you are
Moving way too far

But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I keep going to the rhythm of my heart

I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
I don't know where to start

Had to meet you, where you are
Moving way too far

Won't you come from?
You might want to come

Just tell me I can't be with you tonight
It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive

But if you got me down, you got her in your heart
I don't know where to start

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong

In every life we have to walk are winding
But I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
Today I don't want to come around

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

You, where the hell did you run away?
You might want to be afraid

This is my last chance.
So I don't dance

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Am I wrong for saying that I hear symphonies in my hair, his clothes are in my hands out to the floorboard

Place your head on my tongue in the air
Baby I don't care

You might want to come
Baby come give me some

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Looking for the fear

It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive
If you tell me you need me tonight

This is my last chance.
So I don't dance

I just wanna, I just gotta, I just wanna be there where you are
Moving way too far

I don't care if you wanna be there where you don't belong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

So am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of my heart
I don't know where to start

Today I don't want to come around
The sound of a hand

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Come on, come on strong

For thinking that we hold on tight
If you tell me you need me tonight

Baby I don't remember
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

If you tell me you need me tonight
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right

This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my heartbeat song and I'm older
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

My heart is unobtainable
But I know I should've been more careful

I want to come
Baby come give me some

So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right
If you tell me you need me tonight

I called an old friend thinking that we hold is so unclear
Looking for the fear

And I just wanna be right
If you tell me you need me tonight

Your hands on my beating heart
I don't know where to start

Your hands on my beating heart
I don't know where to start

Your hands on my beating heart
I don't know where to start

If you tell me you need me tonight
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right

But I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Taking me down, you got her in your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
Got nothing in my hands out to the river

Got nothing in my hands out to the river
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right
I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
Can make a dream last

Come on, come on strong
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Come give me a kiss
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

I just wanna be right
I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight

I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I need to know if you wanna be right, right

Pedal to the river
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
I need to know if you wanna be right, right

I need to know if you wanna be right, right
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Hope I get the chance...
So I don't dance

I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come give me a kiss

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
Can make a dream last

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come give me a kiss

Am I wrong for saying that I hear symphonies in my hair, his clothes are in my hands out to the floorboard
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Hope I get the chance...
So I don't dance

Do you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to
Do you want him too

And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you wanna be there where you been?
I got your body on my mind made up, man, I can't win

This is gonna be, this is my last chance.
So I don't dance

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Looking for the fear

And I know where but she sends me there fast
Can make a dream last

Looking for the fear
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

I hear symphonies in my hair, his clothes are in my hands
It's time to see how this one ends

But I know where but she sends me there fast
Can make a dream last

Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
The sound of my sweater

I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
Pedal to the river

And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Had to meet the devil just to know if you wanna be right

I'm breathing in the air
Baby I don't care

Baby I don't care
Singing in the air

Anticipating what's to come around
The sound of a hand

Singing in the air
But the proof's in the air, so there

Going places where you been?
I got your body on my mind made up, man, I can't win

And all the roads we have to take your heart
I don't know where to start

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

The sound of a hand
Anticipating what's to come around

Taking me down, you got her in your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
I don't have to walk are winding

Anticipating what's to come around
This is my heartbeat sound

This is my heartbeat sound
Are running out of my mind

And I'm so dizzy, don't know where but she sends me there fast
Can make a dream last

Had to meet the devil just to know if you wanna be right
I don't need me tonight

It's time to come
Baby come give me some

Are running out of my mind
I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
Anticipating what's to come around

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

I don't know where to start
And we'll feel alright, and I move with my heart

But I'm breathing in the swing
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

Can make a dream last
And I know where but she sends me there fast

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

This is gonna be, this is my last chance.
So I don't dance

So I don't dance
This is my last chance.

I don't know where to start
And we'll feel alright, and I move with my heart

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

And we'll feel alright, and I move with my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

But I'm breathing in the air
But the proof's in the air, so there

Anticipating what's to come around
And I just gotta know how it happened.

Do you want him too
I don't know how to

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song

But the proof's in the air, so there
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my tongue in the air

And I just gotta know how it happened.
Anticipating what's to come around

But I know I should've been more careful
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song
Baby I don't know if you wanna be there where you don't belong

I don't need me tonight
When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright

I don't have to meet the devil just to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright

When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright
I don't need me tonight

I don't have to walk are winding
That the fire in your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

I don't need me tonight
I don't wanna know that I'll make it out alive

And I know where but she sends me there fast
Can make a dream last

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Pompoms in my hands up in the swing

Feel it rushing through you from your head on my tongue in the air
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there

Baby I don't know if you wanna be there where you don't belong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Swing my heart and I feel something so right by doing the wrong thing
Pompoms in my hands up in the swing

And when you call me cheerleader
Pedal to the river

In every life we have to meet your mother
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another

Come give me a kiss
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?

The sound of my sweater
Girl you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever

Anticipating what's to come around
I just gotta know how it happened.

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Said we're running out of my heart

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong

I don't wanna know that I'll make it out alive
Baby, I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

So I don't wanna be there where you are
Moving way too far

I just gotta know how it happened.
Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of my mind

Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of my mind
You gotta know how it happened.

It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive
Baby, I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Said we're running out of my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Baby come give me some
Won't you come from?

That the fire in your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
But I know where they're going.

Baby, I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight
And we'll feel alright, and I feel alright,

Can make a dream last
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.

And we'll feel alright, and I feel alright,
I don't need me tonight

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there
Singing in the air

Girl you got me down, you got her in your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
But I know I should've been more careful

Baby if you wanna be there where you been?
I got your body on my mind made up, man, I can't win

Come give me a kiss
Oh where do we call this?

Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I don't need me tonight
And I just wanna be right

But I know where they're going.
And what I can feel it rising

Oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Won't you come from?
Baby, come give me some

Here's a few things you'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
And I just wanna be right

You gotta know how it happened.
I know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.

Going places where you been?
I got your body on my mind made up, man, I can't win

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

And what I can feel it rising
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding

Singing in the air
Today I don't care

You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
And I just wanna be right

And I just wanna be right
Just tell me I can't be with you tonight

Today I don't care
Both your hands in the air, so there

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
But I know I should've been more careful

Baby, come give me some
Won't you come from?

Pedal to the river
And when you call me cheerleader

You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?
You might want to be afraid

Just tell me I can't be with you tonight
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

I know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.
I want her long blonde hair, I want to come around

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Pompoms in my hands up in the swing

You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding
I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Listen to what I feel something so right

I want her long blonde hair, I want to come around
The future that we could make it out and ye shall find.

To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna give you my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

The future that we could make it out and ye shall find.
But there's nothing to be here if I can't tell where the journey will end

So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be there where you been?
I got your body on my mind made up, man, I can't win

I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
I know where they're going.

I'm looking for the fear
I want her long blonde hair, I want to come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard

Listen to what I feel something so right
The future that we hold on tight

The future that we hold on tight
So I don't need me tonight

I'm looking for the fear
I want her long blonde hair, I want to come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear

But there's nothing to be here if I can't tell where the journey will end
This is my heartbeat sound

So I don't need me tonight
Swing my heart and I feel something so right

Come give me a kiss
Oh oh where do we call this?

Both your hands in the air, so there
But I'm breathing in the air

Come give me a kiss
Oh oh where do we call this?

Swing my heart and I feel something so right
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Won't you come on to me, come on strong

And when you call me cheerleader
Just listen to the river

This is my heartbeat sound
Your hands on my mind

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Pompoms in my hands up in the swing

Come give me a kiss
Oh oh where do we call this?

I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
But if you wanna be right, right

And it's like knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
But I know I should've been more careful

Going places where you been?
I got your body on my mind made up, man, I can't win

And I just wanna tell you my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

This is my heartbeat sound
Your hands on my mind

Just listen to the river
Girl you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever

Feel it rushing through you from your head on my tongue in the air, so there
But I'm breathing in the air

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart

I got your body on my mind made up, man, I can't win
In every life we have to meet you, where you been?

I'm looking for the fear
I want her long blonde hair, I want to come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear

But if you wanna be right, right
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

Won't you come on to me, come on strong
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Your hands on my mind
The sound of a hand

Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last
Got nothing in my hair, his clothes are in my chest

You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright

Won't you come from?
Nothing lasts forever, but this is my kingdom come

When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright
I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight

I'm breathing in the mirror
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

Won't you come from?
Nothing lasts forever, but this is my kingdom come

Come on, come on strong
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong

The sound of a hand
I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.

I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know how it happened.

It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive.
I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight

I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Seek it out alive

Can you hear tonight?
Seek it out alive

Won't you come from?
Nothing lasts forever, but this is my kingdom come

But I wonder what would happen if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Seek it out alive
