 The animals went in two by two, hurrah! hurrah!
The animals went in two by two, hurrah! hurrah!
The animals went in two by two, the elephant and the kangaroo
The animals went in three by three, hurrah! hurrah!
The animals went in four by four, hurrah! hurrah!
The animals went in five by five, they warmed each other to keep alive
The animals went in seven by seven, hurrah! hurrah!
The animals went in seven by seven, the little pig thought he was going to heaven
The animals went in eight by eight, the turtle thought that he was coming late,
The animals went in nine by nine, hurrah! hurrah!
Point to the door
Went out one day
What's the magic word?
Hmmm.
These are the nice words you can say
Golden slumbers kiss your eyes
And I will sing a lullaby.
While over you a watch I'll keep
And I will sing a lullaby.

at my ever-open book
we'll turn
at our ever-open book
One Brown Mouse sitting in a cage 
For she crept under
Clean up, clean up.
Everybody, let's clean up.
Clean up! Clean up! Clean up!
Pick up your books.
You'll regret it all one day
This old man comes rolling home
He plays knick knack on my door
This old man comes rolling home 
Clap them low by your toes

Well done!
To get out of the rain, BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

But do not let them in, in, in.

Eating some most delicious bugs.
One jumped into the pool,
Where it was nice and cool,
GLUB! GLUB!
He jumped into the pool,
Oh, old Mother Goose
Had a house in the woods,
You'd see quite a brood!
Looking after her sheep;
She'd jump on her broomstick
Up the beanstalk she'd go,
And then off she would go,
Short and stouts
I'm a very special pot
It's true
Have a taste, have a taste
They're the best in all the land
Was all that he could see  
This little piggy stayed home.
And this little piggy went
This little piggy dressed up
Hiding behind a tree
Build it up with iron bars, iron bars, iron bars
Build it up with iron bars, my fair lady.
Along came a spider
Yankee Doodle went to town
Riding on a pony
And called it macaroni.
Yankee Doodle keep it up,
Yankee Doodle dandy,
And have some tasty candy.
To be quick, quick, quick;
And he knocked at the door
And he shook his head,
He wrote out a paper
For a pill, pill, pill,
Bake me a cake as fast as you can
Prick it and pat it and mark it with a "b"
Make it the prettiest you've ever seen
Mix it and stir it and bake it just right
And make pretty flowers here and there
Prick it and price it and mark it with a "b"
They found their mittens,
Our mittens we have found.
What! Found your mittens,
And hung them out to dry;
Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush!
One potato, two potatoes, three potatoes, four.
And one for my dame
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow
Mary went, Mary went
He followed her to school one day
To see a lamb at school
And so the teacher turned him out
Turned him out, turned him out
But still he lingered near
And waited patiently
And wai-aited patiently
Til Mary did appear
Tap tap tap.
I'm a Yankee Doodle dandy
Of my Uncle Sam's
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart
She's my Yankee Doodle joy
Yankee Doodle came to town
I am that Yankee Doodle boy
