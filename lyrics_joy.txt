Please and thank you, please and thank you
Smiles await you when you rise
Round and round the cobbler's bench

Shall we wake them with a merry tune?

Eyes are blue - lovely too.

Some of Jack Horner's pie,
I'm a little teapot

The muffin man, the muffin man
Hello, I'm the muffin man
From the muffin man.
All the land, all the land
Thank you mister muffin man
Muffin man, muffin man
Thank you mister muffin man 
Wee, wee, wee

This little piggy drew some shapes
And this little piggy read books
Mr. Sun, Sun, Mister Golden Sun Lyrics
Oh Mr. Sun Sun, Mister Golden Sun
Iron bars will bend and bread, bend and break, bend and break,
Iron bars will bend and break, my fair lady.
Build it up with gold and silver, gold and silver, gold and silver,
Build it up with gold and silver my fair lady.
Eating her curds and whey
Mind the music and the step,
Gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream
Life is but a dream 
With his bag and his hat,
"That'll make her better,
Yes it will, will, will!"
Oh, rig-a-jig-jig and away we go,
Rig-a-jig-jig and away we go,
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho
A girl who can twirl I chanced to meet
A-rig-a-jig-jig and away we go,
Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake baker's man
And put it in the oven for Billy and me
Make it with chocolate, make it with cream
Write his name wit lots of care
Three little kittens,
The three little kittens,
See here, see here,
You darling kittens!
Then you shall have some pie.
You shall have some pie.
Put on their mittens,
And soon ate up the pie;
Look here, look here,
Our mittens we have washed.
Five potatoes, six potatoes, seven potatoes, more.
This is the way we take a bath.
Yes sir, yes sir,
Three bags full
One for my master
And one for the little boy
Little lamb, little lamb
School one day, school one day
It made the children laugh and play
Laugh and play, laugh and play
Apples and bananas, one more time!
A real live nephew
Born on the Fourth of July
Just to ride the ponies
