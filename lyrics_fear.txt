Let's see if we can name a few, are you ready? 
Please, please, please
If he hollers let him go! 
O-U-T spells out
Out goes Y-O-U 
Hop, hop, hop...
Skip little bunnies, skip, skip, skip
Skip, skip, skip - skip, skip, skip
Skip little bunnies, skip, skip, skip 
Skip, skip, skip... 
Jump, jump, jump... 
hop, hop, hop... 
Rosy lips, teeth within
Please, please, the sunscreen's good for you
No, no, no, I'm too scared to climb the bars
No, no, no, I'm too scared to try the slide
Don't be in such a hurry
When you get impatient, you only start to worry
Remember, remember that God is patient, too
Think about this little song and take a tip from Herb 
Do you wonder if I really care for you
The frying pan.
Please don't take my sunshine away
Please don't take my sunshine away 
He plays knick knack on my knee
He plays knick knack on my gate
He plays knick knack on my vine
Sat on a speckled log
For dessert they might try
Here is my handle
Here is my spout
To see what he could see
To see what he could see,
Please shine down on me
Please come out so we can play with you
Sat on a tuffet,
Row, row, row your boat
 Row, row, row your boat
So she called for the doctor
The doctor came
With a rat-a-tat-tat.
Down the street, down the street,
Please
Good from the first 'til the very last bite
We sadly fear
We greatly fear
I can wash my shoulders.
Have you any wool?
Patiently, patiently
