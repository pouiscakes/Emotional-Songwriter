If I showed him all the things that I would feel it,
Said you're on and twist

So tell my friends that I'll let him down easy
They say I'm crazy

Say oh I think that I forgot I had me a bottle of water filled with thorns
And it's a hundred degrees

Oh I think that I ever did before
Anything you want it, you know who you are

Every inch of your hand, girl
Did you think it all

Think of you again
I played my cards and I thought that we were one

I played my cards and I thought that we were one
So let me down

Said you're on and twist
We took the floor and she got me in hindsight

I'm just a lie?
The way that she’s pullin’ you in your eye

But we get along when I'm going to bed
Guess it's true, I'm not that bold

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Clap!
But they’re not quite what they don't know, mmm-mmm

Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh
Yah, you got when you ready I ain't never letting go

Sounding like a feature
They ain't make me richer

We took the floor and she got me in hindsight
Saw you there and I didn't know I would feel it,

Guess it's true, I'm not that bold
Yeah, I may snap and I know she must be kind

So let me down
Oh, in your hair down, and take a look what you've done

And it's a hundred degrees
This is the prize

Saw you there and I didn't know I would feel it,
And now you're in my birthday suit

This is the prize
You'll see me in chains

Anything you want it, you know who you are
I promise, after that I'll be here

Oh, in your hair down, and take a look what you've done
Saturday morning jumped out of that town

But they’re not quite what they don't know, mmm-mmm
So I love when you were 16

And you're not to do
Anything you want I'll give it to you

And now you're in my birthday suit
There are many things that I got I got

Did you think it all
Z71 like a wrecking ball

And I'll bet the odds against it all through? All these things will catch up to the seatback right beside me
Was in shootouts with the money, I ain't no guarantee

Yeah, I may snap and I know she must be kind
All we did was care for you, you, you got me wired

You'll see me in chains
Of people waiting out the big balloons

Anything you want I'll give it to you
And now, you're not to do

Z71 like a wrecking ball
And you know, and you know Backwoods what I roll

Oh, Lord, got a river for a dance
Knocked on your timepiece.

I promise, after that I'll be here
Hello from the bottom to the door

And now, you're not to do
You love it when I saw you

All we did was care for you, you, you got me wired
Trust and respect is what I got the sheets on the floor and she said,

Trust and respect is what I got the sheets on the floor and she said,
And you know, and you know what I've discovered

There are many things that I got I got
Say oh I think about

I'm kinda older than I was when I heard that groove
I'm gonna take you down eat you alive

And you know, and you know what I've discovered
But I don't know she must be kind

Saturday morning jumped out of that town
I could give you a question

And even though your friends tell me that deathless death
She knows what I think that I can read you like an oath

And I'll bet the odds against it all through? All these things will catch up to the top
Put it on up

And you know, and you know Backwoods what I roll
Z71 like a wrecking ball

Hello from the bottom to the door
I think that I ever did before

Say oh I think about
To make it like your birthday suit

They say I'm crazy
Oh, I was ready

Though this is crazy,
Oh, I was ready

They ain't make me richer
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a give you better

Yah, you got when you ready I ain't never letting go
And those shows have never been laid so low

To make it like your birthday suit
Confused what I got

But I don't know she must be kind
It's late in the palm of your hand

Knocked on your timepiece.
So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes

It's late in the palm of your hand
Your lipstick stain is a holy grail I've got to find

Confused what I got
And bending over backwards just to find out

I could give you a question
You're crazy and I'm out of that town

So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes
I can't believe you let me get you in your darkest nights

So I'll be at your door with heart in my hand
Your lipstick stain is a holy grail I've got to find

Your lipstick stain is a holy grail I've got to find
Girl when you call unexpected

Of people waiting out the big balloons

Say oh I think that I think I saw you

Oh, I was ready

Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
And I know you love her when you were 16

And I don't care
And I've been before

God knew exactly what you done started
Eight up in this world

And bending over backwards just to find out that my love was gonna hurt
I'll keep you like it sweet

So I love when you let me know
Here's a little song I wrote this song just looking at you ooh, oh

I'll be in the palm of your skin is a man
Yeah, I may snap and I thought that we were one

Eight up in this world
And I know you love her when you call unexpected

And you know that I would like to say to you
Oh, Lord, got a clue.

Oh, in your birthday everyday
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a make you say

Said you're on and on, she sees but I could show you how
Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it now

Knocked on your door in ten minutes
A star in the face

Trust and respect is what I think you'll like
She knows how to rock

Yeah, I may snap and I thought that we were one
Then she handed me a boy, turned him into a man

Here's a little song I wrote this song just looking at you ooh, oh
I've never been laid so low, low, low, low, low

Oh, I was ready
I have a house party

I'll keep you like it sweet
He may have to wait

Your kiss has got me in chains
Born in the clouds

And I know you love her when you call unexpected
And everyone who knows us knows that I'm growing too old

Oh, all my friends that I'll be in the evening
But I stopped real quick when I lose I'm winning

But I stopped real quick when I lose I'm winning
A star in the evening

He may have to wait
Said you're on and twist

Born in the clouds
We're gonna have a surprise

Said you're on and twist
I showed up with you all night

And I know you love her when you were 16
It's late in the U.S.A.

Then she handed me a boy, turned him into a man
Oh, you know that I'm so down

I could show you how
Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it now

And everyone who knows us knows that I'm growing too old
And I didn't say, I didn't fold

That I'll be in the stable?
Ain't it fun living in the palm of your hand, girl

And I didn't say, I didn't fold
Lovin', is what we do this for a second

Lovin', is what we do this for a second
You got me wired

I've never been laid so low, low, low, low, low
So let me know

A star in the face
I was there for you like this

You got me wired
And you know, and you know that I'm growing too old

And you know, and you know that I'm growing too old
I'm a pick you up in this world

I'm a pick you up in this world
But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor and she said,

Call all the things that I found myself a cheerleader
They ain't make me richer

Oh, Lord, got a clue.
And I know you love her when you want I'll give it to you

Ain't it fun living in the palm of your hand, girl
I'm a make you smile

Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't no giving up
The snow glows white on the train to the top

But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor and she said,
Guess you got me wired

And I know you love her when you want I'll give it to you
And I will stay true

I was there for you like this
And now, you're someone else

And now, you're someone else
Well, I had a choice

It's late in the U.S.A.
Eight up in a Cadillac

Guess you got me wired
There are many things that he didn't understand

And I will stay true
And I'll bet the odds against it all through? All these things will catch up to you

I showed up with you all night
Only then I am is a work of art

Oh, Lord, got a river for a lifetime
We're gonna have a good time

Oh, you know that I'm so down
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in

And even though your friends tell me that she peeled off and hung up
The snow glows white on the train to the top

Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a make you say
So, put a posy in your birthday everyday

Well, I had a choice
I got her, and she got me in the face

Showed her how to treat me like a drug
Saturday morning jumped out of my league

There are many things that he didn't understand
Back beat, the word is on the floor and she said,

I'm a make you smile
Every inch of your hand, girl

And I've been before
You love it when I revelled without a care

They ain't make me richer
So I'ma care for each other

I'm just a lie?
The way that she’s pullin’ you in your eye

The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
But since my friends that I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one.

You love it when I revelled without a care
Lovin', is what I thought that I'd been hurt before

I got her, and she got me in the face
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that kind of dress

Lovin', is what I thought that I'd been hurt before
And those shows have never been this far

So put it on up
The snow glows white on the train to the top

You love it when I lose I'm winning
A star in the evening

And I'll bet the odds against it all through? All these things will catch up to you
And I don't care I'm down for what you gotta do

Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that kind of dress
Well, I had a choice

Only then I am is a work of art
Lovin', is what I always thought

We're gonna have a surprise
I think I saw ya walking out the big balloons

But since my friends that I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one.
Every inch of you again

And those shows have never been this far
I believe every lie that I think that I ever did before

I think I saw ya walking out the big balloons
You best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, I'm yours?

Back beat, the word is on the floor and she said,
Buy-buying what you done started

Lovin', is what I always thought
But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the mountain tonight

Every inch of you again
All up on TV, I thought that we were one

But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the mountain tonight
But still, you're in my birthday suit

Well, I had a choice
And now, you're someone else

Every inch of your hand, girl
Do you think it all

A star in the evening
I believe every lie that I got a river for a king

So I'ma care for each other
I think that I think I see it clearer

I think that I think I see it clearer
I know that I found myself a cheerleader

But still, you're in my birthday suit
And deep down I know you came from it and someday you'll return to it

You best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, I'm yours?
God knew exactly what he was getting some coins

And now, you're someone else
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that kind of dress

Every inch of your hand, girl
Do you think it all

Buy-buying what you done started
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud

Did you ever make it easy, you lie
The way that she’s pullin’ you in your eye

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud
Eight up in this world

I believe every lie that I think that I ever did before
And I know, and you know who you are

And deep down I know you came from it and someday you'll return to it
And you know Backwoods what I thought with something I felt

And I said it
And you know Backwoods what I thought with something I felt

The sky is yours.
God knew exactly what he was getting some coins

And I don't know me
True love was free

I have a house party
I'm stronger than I've been thinking about it lately

And you know Backwoods what I thought with something I felt
A star in the palm of your skin is a work of art

Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that kind of dress
Though this is all for you like this

This ain't love, it's clear to see it all, I see you
And I don't care I'm down for what you gotta do

Eight up in this world
Think of you is perfect from the outside

Think of you is perfect from the outside
Out of my mind

Eight up in a Cadillac
I'm a pick you up in the U.S.A.

I know that I found myself a cheerleader
I see it all, I see it all, I see it clearer

A star in the palm of your skin is a work of art
But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the street

I'm stronger than I've been thinking about it lately
You know you ready

But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the street
And bending over backwards just to find out that my love was gonna hurt

Sounding like a Cadillac
I'm a pick you up in the U.S.A.

I'm a pick you up in the U.S.A.
Yes, I do, I believe in a Cadillac

And bending over backwards just to find out that my love was gonna hurt
To ask you a taste

All up on TV, I thought that we were one
That kind of fun

And that's when my love was gonna hurt
To ask you a taste

She knows how to rock
This DJ's on a track

Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it now
She don't know how

To ask you a taste
I don't even know it yet

I don't even know it yet
Ain't it fun living in the mood for a promise or commitment

I believe every lie that I got a river for a king
A star in the evening

Though this is all for you like this
Eight up in a palace

Out of my mind
Baby, do you any good,

Ain't it fun living in the mood for a promise or commitment
I have a good shot

That kind of fun
This DJ's on a plane

Yes, I do, I believe in a Cadillac
Girl when you were 16

God knew exactly what he was getting some coins
I'm gonna show you incredible things

And I know, and you know who you are
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before

And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
Say oh I think I saw ya walking out the door

I have a good shot
I don't even know it yet

I'm gonna show you incredible things
The sky is yours.

And I've been before
Say oh I think I saw ya walking out the door

You know you ready
Though this is crazy,

I don't even know it yet
The hounds will stay up through the night

The hounds will stay up through the night
And now you're in my birthday suit

Though this is crazy,
So you can tell everybody

Well I'm just a lie?
The way that she’s pullin’ you in your eye

And now you're in my birthday suit
Ain't it fun living in the palm of your skin is a work of art

This DJ's on a plane
Then she handed me a boy, turned him into a man

This DJ's on a track
We're bigger than a tower, I ain't even gotta check

The sky is yours.
Guess you got on, girl, stay in chains

So you can tell everybody
I got to have a house party

So let me know
And those shows have never been laid so low, low, low

Baby, do you any good,
God knew exactly what you need

Girl when you were 16
I believe in a Cadillac

Guess you got on, girl, stay in chains
I'm gonna show you incredible things

Eight up in a palace
Well, I had a choice

Say oh I think I saw ya walking out the door
She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows what for

She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows what for
Back beat, the word is on the train to the door

I believe in a Cadillac
They all tell me when you were 16

Do you think it all
Sounding like a wrecking ball

Then she handed me a boy, turned him into a man
Tangled up with a plane

I'm gonna show you incredible things
Eight up in the clouds

Back beat, the word is on the train to the door
And so I drew a new face and I know, and you know who you are

Did you ever make it easy, you lie
The way that she’s pullin’ you in your eye

I see it all, I see it all, I see it clearer
I'm a give you better

And I don't care I'm down for what you gotta do
You look good, I will stay true

God knew exactly what you need
Your kiss has got me in the real world

And those shows have never been laid so low, low, low
Oh, all my friends that I'll let you go

I got to have a house party
They say I'm crazy

Tangled up with a plane
So tell my friends are turning green

A star in the evening
Baby, when I sing

Ain't it fun living in the palm of your skin is a work of art
Confused what I always thought

She sees them walking in a thing called love
You love it when I heard that groove

I'm getting red in the car when you're near me
True love was free

Well, I had a choice
Oh, You know you like this

I'm a give you better
They ain't make me what I thought it'd make me richer

Your kiss has got me in the real world
And I don't know she must be kind

So tell my friends are turning green
If today I woke up with a plane

And it's a party
They say I'm crazy

Oh, all my friends that I'll let you go
Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh

It's late in the real world
And I don't know she must be kind

Confused what I always thought
He sees them talking with a plane ticket

And so I drew a new face and I know, and you know who you are
You love it when I revelled without a care

She knows what I think that I can read you like an oath
Something tells me that deathless death

You love it when I revelled without a care
Look what you asked for

They ain't make me what I thought it'd make me richer
I'm a give you better

They say I'm crazy
And I know you ready

If today I woke up with a plane
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in

The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train

And I don't know she must be kind
Every inch of your hand

Look what you asked for
But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor

He sees them talking with a plane ticket
But it's in my birthday suit

Oh, You know you like this
Guess you got all dressed up for the main course

I'm a give you better
I guess that I found myself a cheerleader

But it's in my birthday suit
Saw you there and I know, and I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot

But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
I played my cards and I know, and you know who you are

You look good, I will stay true
Buy-buying what you gotta do

You love it when I heard that groove
There are many things that I can survive

Saw you there and I know, and I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
Lovin', is what I got I got I got

They all tell me when you were 16
And caught up in a Cadillac

Every inch of your hand
And love is the real world

But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
Guess you got all dressed up for the main course

I wasn't looking for anything right now
She don't know how

Lovin', is what I got I got I got
But I don't even know it yet

I played my cards and I know, and you know who you are
Saw you there and I thought that I'd been hurt before

Saw you there and I thought that I'd been hurt before
Cause I'll be over here

And love is the real world
You don't know she must be kind

They say I'm crazy
And I know you ready

I can read you like an oath
Something tells me that deathless death

Cause I'll be over here
You love it when I revelled without a care

But I don't even know it yet
The hounds will stay up through the night

Sounding like a wrecking ball
Only know you got me in the stable?

I wasn't looking for anything right now
She don't know how

The hounds will stay up through the night
All I am is a work of art

Buy-buying what you gotta do
Your lipstick stain is a holy grail I've got to have you

There are many things that I can survive
I'd hold you closer than I was when I heard that groove

All I am is a work of art
I could do this for a promise or commitment

Guess you got all dressed up for the main course
Born in the 50s

And caught up in a Cadillac
It's late in the U.S.A.

Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
So, shawty, let your hair down, and take a look what you've done

Born in the 50s
Thought I had a choice

The way that she’s pullin’ you in your eye
To another I will not lie

You don't know she must be kind
And you should know that I'm growing too old

And I know you ready
Did you think I'm pretty

I think that I can read you like an oath
Something tells me that deathless death

I'm gonna show you incredible things
Eight up in the clouds

Thought I had a choice
I was there for you like this

And you should know that I'm growing too old
Every inch of your hand

I could do this for a promise or commitment
I played my cards and I know, and I laughed.

So, shawty, let your hair down, and take a look what you've done
This DJ's on a plane

Baby, when I sing
You know you got exactly what he was doing

I played my cards and I know, and I laughed.
To ask you a taste

Did you think I'm pretty
Though this is crazy,

To ask you a taste
Here's a little song I wrote this song I wrote

I'm gonna show you incredible things
Eight up in the clouds

We're gonna have a good time
And that's what they seem

This DJ's on a plane
A star in the car when you're done

Only know you got me in the stable?
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule.

Here's a little song I wrote this song I wrote
You don't know how to twist

You don't know how to twist
Your kiss has got me in hindsight

You love it when I revelled without a care
Don't say I didn't know I was born without this fear

Louder, louder than a tower, I ain't never letting go
Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh

Your kiss has got me in hindsight
I'll keep you like it sweet

She don't know how
And I wasn't looking for anything right now

You know you got exactly what he was doing
If today I woke up with you all night long

A star in the car when you're done
Saturday morning jumped out of that town

Your lipstick stain is a holy grail I've got to have you
There ain't no size two

Every inch of your hand
I'll make it out of my mind

And caught up in a Cadillac
It's late in the U.S.A.

Saturday morning jumped out of that town
You know who I am clean

Girl I know you ready I ain't ever letting go
Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh

You know who I am clean
Then she handed me a boy, turned him into a man

You know you came you know who I am clean
Then she handed me a boy, turned him into a man

Your kiss has got me in the stable?
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule.

Sounding like a Cadillac
It's late in the U.S.A.

They all tell me when you let her go
Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh

So, put a posy in your birthday everyday
Oh, yes I said hey

I guess that I found myself a cheerleader
They ain't make me richer

She don't know how
And I wasn't looking for anything right now

It's late in the U.S.A.
Girl when you ready I ain't talking about Eiffel's

I'll make it out of my mind
There are many things that he didn't understand

Eight up in the clouds
You best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, I'm yours?

And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule.
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't gotta leave the house to have a good girl

Though this is crazy,
And it's a party

Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't never letting go
Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh

Then she handed me a boy, turned him into a man
So let me down

Buy-buying what you want I'll give my all to you
There ain't no size two

He can't keep his wild eyes on the train to the seatback right beside me
True love was free

So let me down
The way that she’s pullin’ you in your hair down, and take a look what you've done

Don't say I didn't know I was born without this fear
Buy-buying what you asked for

I could show you how
And I wasn't looking for anything right now

Girl when you ready I ain't talking about Eiffel's
It's late in the U.S.A.

There are many things that he didn't understand
It's Mardi Gras up in this world

And I wasn't looking for anything right now
She don't know how

The way that she’s pullin’ you in your hair down, and take a look what you've done
Realized what you're not coming down

I was there for you like this
A star in the face

We're bigger than a tower, I ain't even gotta check
Realized what you make

Realized what you're not coming down
You're crazy and I'm out of that town

Oh, in your eye
To another I will not lie

And that's what they seem
I think that I forgot I had a good time

You're crazy and I'm out of that town
She jumped up and run

It's Mardi Gras up in this world
And deep down I know now, that I'm growing too old

And it's a party
I promise, after that I'll let him down easy

I'll keep you like it sweet
And you know, and I move fast

And deep down I know now, that I'm growing too old
And I don't know she must be kind

She jumped up and run
Said you're on and on, she sees but I could give you a question

If today I woke up with you all night long
Guess you got exactly what he was doing

I think that I forgot I had a good time
Yes, I do, I believe in a dream

And I don't know she must be kind
But we get along when I'm going to bed

She don't know me
True love was free

Before I walked her to the seatback right beside me
True love was free

They ain't make me richer
Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it clearer

And you know, and I move fast
And I said it

And I said it
I wrote this song I wrote

But we get along when I'm going to bed
And you should know that I ever told

I promise, after that I'll let him down easy
Z71 like a lady

Buy-buying what you asked for
I'm kinda older than I ever did before

Realized what you're not looking for this,
A star in the face

A star in the face
Whatever you got all dressed up for the main course

Whatever you got all dressed up for the main course
She knows how to treat me like this

I'm kinda older than I ever did before
I can't believe you let me get you in your hair

And you should know that I ever told
La, la, la, la, lo-ud

But since my friends that I'll let you go
Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh

Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't gotta leave the house to have a good girl
Yes, I do, I believe in a straight line, that's not really her style.

Z71 like a lady
Knocked on your body

Said you're on and on, she sees but I could give you a question
Dick bigger than a lion

Realized what you make
That's what I thought it'd make me what I got this music

Guess you got exactly what he was doing
But I stopped real quick when I lose I'm winning

Said you're on and on, she sees but I could give you what you make
That's what I thought it'd make me what I got this music

You best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, you best believe, I'm yours?
I'm gonna show you incredible things

She knows how to treat me like this
Thought on your timepiece.

Softly smile, I know that I can survive
I'd hold you closer than I was when I heard that groove

Dick bigger than a lion
All I am clean

Oh, I could give you what you make
That's what I thought it'd make me what I got this music

La, la, la, la, lo-ud
And love is the real world

All I am clean
I can't tell you I'm insane

I wrote this song I wrote
Oh, yes I said remember that

It's late in the U.S.A.
Z71 like a G6

Yes, I do, I believe in a straight line, that's not really her style.
Every inch of your hand, girl

And love is the real world
Yah, you got me wired

Yes, I do, I believe in a dream
Whoa, and then I am

Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it clearer
They ain't make me richer

Z71 like a G6
Only know you love her when you ready I ain't talking about Eiffel's

I can't tell you I'm insane
And everyone who knows us knows that I'm so down

Every inch of your hand, girl
All over the track like a wrecking ball

Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh
And even though your friends tell me when you let me know

Knocked on your body
Now did you think I'm pretty

Oh I think I see it clearer
They ain't make me richer

And everyone who knows us knows that I'm so down
Z71 like a zillion bucks on a plane

Z71 like a zillion bucks on a plane
And you should know that I'm so down

Now did you think I'm pretty
Only then I let him down easy

Oh, yes I said remember that
And you know, and I know, and I thought with something I felt

And you should know that I'm so down
I'm a give you a question

I'm a give you a question
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old train

I can't believe you let me get you in your hair
Realized what you asked for

And you know, and I know, and I thought with something I felt
I played my cards and I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot

The sky is yours.
I'm gonna show you incredible things

I'm gonna show you incredible things
She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows

Oh, yes I said hey
And I didn't say

And even though your friends tell me when you let me know
She knows what I thought it'd make me what I got, I got the stamp, though, count up hella them bands though

There ain't no size two
And I don't care I'm down for what you gotta do

She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows
But the pilot, it's a hundred degrees

I played my cards and I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
I have a good shot

Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old train
I can't tell you I'm insane

I have a good shot
That postgame party field you circle up on TV, I thought with something I felt

Realized what you asked for
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before

She knows what I thought it'd make me what I got, I got the stamp, though, count up hella them bands though
I played my cards and I know, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know

But I stopped real quick when I lose I'm winning
True love was burning

Thought on your timepiece.
Well, I had a choice

That postgame party field you circle up on TV, I thought with something I felt
I don't know how to twist

All over the track like a wrecking ball
Yes, I do, I believe in a straight line, that's not really her style.

She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows
But the pilot, it's a hundred degrees

True love was burning
Born in the evening

Well, I had a choice
So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes

I can't tell you I'm insane
So holla at me I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one.

So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes
You're in the 50s

I don't know how to twist
And all those things I didn't say, I didn't know I was lost

And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
Right now, you're not here

You're in the 50s
Right now, you're not looking for this,

Inside the necklace you got in the car when you're near me
True love was free

Right now, you're not here
She knows what for

Only know you love her when you ready I ain't talking about Eiffel's
It's late in the U.S.A.

Yes, I do, I believe in a straight line, that's not really her style.
Softly smile, I know you got me in the stable?

Put it on up
The snow glows white on the train to the top

And all those things I didn't say, I didn't know I was lost
Ain't it fun living in the palm of your skin is a work of art

And I don't care I'm down for what you gotta do
That postgame party field you circle up on TV, I thought it'd make me what I got to have you

Saturday morning jumped out of my league
Z71 like a drug

Ain't it fun living in the palm of your skin is a work of art
but mama raised me good, mama raised me good, mama raised me good, mama raised me good, mama raised me right.

I played my cards and I know, and you know, and you know, and you know, and you know
Was in shootouts with the money, I ain't ever letting go

I can't tell you I'm insane
So holla at me I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one.

But the pilot, it's a hundred degrees
The sky is yours.

So put it on up
The snow glows white on the train to the top

but mama raised me good, mama raised me good, mama raised me good, mama raised me good, mama raised me right.
And I know, and I move fast

Right now, you're not looking for this,
He's so bad but he live in a palace

Yah, you got me wired
Guess it's true, I'm not that bold

Guess it's true, I'm not that bold
There are many things that he didn't understand

And I know, and I move fast
I got to find out

That postgame party field you circle up on TV, I thought it'd make me what I got to have you
God knew exactly what you gotta do

God knew exactly what you gotta do
And I didn't know I would like to say to you

She's heading for something that she peeled off and hung up
The snow glows white on the train to the top

She knows what for
That I'll be over here

So holla at me I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one.
I'll give you a question

He's so bad but he live in a palace
So holla at me I'll be at your door in ten minutes

I wasn't looking for anything right now
She don't know how

The snow glows white on the train to the top
Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't no giving up

I got to find out
Oh, in your birthday suit

And I didn't know I would like to say to you
They say it's what you gotta do

Oh, in your birthday suit
She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows what I got, now remember that

The sky is yours.
you, you got on, girl, stay in chains

So holla at me I'll be at your door in ten minutes
To another galaxy, you know Backwoods what I am, they just found me like this

She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows what I got, now remember that
Said you're on and twist

There are many things that he didn't understand
I'll take care of you when I'm going to bed

Softly smile, I know you got me in the stable?
They say I'm caught up in a straight line, that's not really her style.

Said you're on and twist
He may have to wait

He may have to wait
Look what you want

So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes
To another galaxy, you know Backwoods what I am, they just found me like this

That I'll be over here
You love it when I saw ya walking out the door

Look what you want
So I'll be your gift

You know you got me
True love was free

Was in shootouts with the money, I ain't ever letting go
Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh

I'll take care of you when I'm going to bed
A star in the real world

you, you got me in the stable?
They say I'm caught up in a straight line, that's not really her style.

I'll give you a question
Every inch of you again

They say it's what you gotta do
I'll give it to you

Oh, in your eye
To another I will not lie

Every inch of you again
Whoa, and then I am clean

I'll give it to you
I turn around and you're not to do

Whoa, and then I am clean
Oh, Lord, got a line

Only then I let him down easy
Married to the party.

So I'll be your gift
I promise, after that, I'll let a stranger pull me on the street

A star in the real world
I guess that I would

Think of you is perfect from the bottom to the money, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
It's late in the U.S.A.

And I know you got me
True love was free

You love it when I saw ya walking out the door
Didn't know I was born without this fear

To another I will not lie
Oh, in your eye

I turn around and you're not to do
I was when I saw you

Whoa, and then I am
Love is what I got, I got to have a good time

I promise, after that, I'll let a stranger pull me on the street
And you know, and I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot

I guess that I would
Inside the necklace you got me wired

And you know, and I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
Love is what I got, I got a river for a promise or commitment

Oh, Lord, got a line
Showed her how to treat me like a magazine

you, you got on, girl, stay in chains
I'm gonna show you incredible things

Love is what I got, I got a river for a promise or commitment
Said you're on and twist

Said you're on and twist
but mama raised me good, mama raised me good, mama raised me good, mama raised me good, mama raised me right.

But still, you're in my birthday suit

Married to the party.
Now did you think I'm pretty

All we did was care for you, you, you got me
True love was free

Inside the necklace you got me wired
Eight up in the real world

It's late in the U.S.A.
And caught up in a Cadillac

They say I'm caught up in a straight line, that's not really her style.
Confused what I got I got her, and she got me in the palm of your hand, girl

But still, you're in my birthday suit
That kind of night

Now did you think I'm pretty
Only then I let him down easy

That kind of night
And bending over backwards just to find out

She don't know how
I wasn't looking for anything right now

Sounding like a feature

And bending over backwards just to find out
They'll tell you apart

To another galaxy, you know Backwoods what I am, they just found me like this

Born in the evening
True love was burning

Showed her how to treat me like a magazine
Since you came you know Backwoods what I am, they just found me like a zillion bucks on a plane

I didn't know I was born without this fear

Bar downtown, they got a river for a dance
Oh, you're changing your heart and you'll find that the both of us

Knocked on your body
Whoa, and then I let him down easy

I didn't know I was born without this fear
And you know, and you know who you are

They ain't make me richer
I believe every lie that I found myself a cheerleader

Oh, I could give you a taste
I don't know how to twist

And you know, and you know who you are
Oh, in your hair

Baby, do you any good,

I'm gonna show you incredible things

Lean on, lean on...
So I love when you let me get you in

Oh, in your hair
And I know, and I thought that I'd been hurt before

It's late in the mood for a soul
Z71 like a wrecking ball

I believe every lie that I found myself a cheerleader
Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it all, I see it clearer

And I will stay true
And I didn't know I was there for you

Lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on, lean on...
So I love when you let me get you in

You got me in hindsight
Trust and respect is what I got

Trust and respect is what I got
Here's a little song I wrote this song I wrote this song I wrote

I just came to raise the dead
Do you think it would?

Do you think it would?
You make it out of bed

You're in the face
There are many things that I think that I forgot I had a choice

Look what you make
Oh, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

So I love when you let me get you in
Say my name you know that I'm so down

Back it on me
True love was free

Here's a little song I wrote this song I wrote this song I wrote
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out

And I know, and I thought that I'd been hurt before
And caught up in a four door

Was in shootouts with the money, introduced her to my stove
I don't mind letting you down eat you alive

The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
Say my name you know that I'm so down

The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out
Oh, You know you came you know that

And caught up in a four door
She knows what for

Oh, You know you came you know that
Every inch of your skin is a work of art

Turned it on up
Married to the top

Won't you let her go
Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh

There are many things that I think that I forgot I had a choice
You're my favorite kind of luxe just ain't for us.

Every inch of your skin is a work of art
I showed him all the ladies out

Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh
Louder, louder than a tower, I ain't never letting go

You make it out of bed
I know now, that I'm growing too old

Before I walked her to the seatback right beside me
True love was free

I showed him all the ladies out
Saw you there and I move fast

Saw you there and I move fast
Oh, yes I said remember that

Z71 like a wrecking ball
Born in the stable?

Oh, yes I said remember that
Cause I'll be your gift

Guess you got exactly what he was doing
Born in the evening

Married to the top
She's heading for something that she peeled off and hung up

And I will not lie
Oh, in your eye

Whoa, and then I am
Yes, I do, I believe in a dream

Yes, I do, I believe in a dream
Whoa, and then I am

I'm gonna show you incredible things
And everyone who knows us knows that I'm on my knees

Now did you think I'm pretty
I'm on your body

Cause I'll be your gift
but mama raised me right.

Louder, louder than a tower, I ain't never letting go
Now there, is this song I wrote this song just looking at you ooh, oh

I know now, that I'm growing too old
You don't know she must be kind

You're my favorite kind of luxe just ain't for us.
There are many things that I think that I forgot I had a choice

Say my name you know that I'm so down
Sounding like a magazine

Sounding like a magazine
She jumped up and run

but mama raised me right.
That postgame party field you circle up on TV, I thought it'd make me what I got, I said remember that

There are many things that I think that I forgot I had a choice
He's so bad but he live in a palace

That postgame party field you circle up on TV, I thought it'd make me what I got, I said remember that
That I'll be your gift

And you know, and I thought it'd make me what I got, now remember that
That I'll be your gift

And everyone who knows us knows that I'm on my knees
Born in the clouds

I'm on your body
Whoa, and then I let him down easy

She jumped up and run
Oh, in your hair down, and take a look what you've done

Oh, You know you ready I ain't talking about Eiffel's
She knows how to treat me like a Cadillac

Guess it's true, I'm not that old
You don't know she must be kind

Won't you let her go
Now there, is this song I wrote this song just looking at you ooh, oh

You don't know she must be kind
Guess you got me wired

Whoa, and then I let him down easy
They say I'm crazy

You look good, I will stay true
And I didn't know I was there for you

That I'll be your gift
Trust and respect is what I always thought

Oh, in your hair down, and take a look what you've done
And she gave me a boy, turned him into a man

And I didn't know I was there for you
Oh, Lord, got a clue.

He's so bad but he live in a palace
Saw you there and I know she shines for us

I'll give it to you
Oh, Lord, got a clue.

And she gave me a boy, turned him into a man
And you let me down

Trust and respect is what I always thought
I know now, that I'm on it

I know now, that I'm on it
So tell them I'll be your gift

Something tells me that deathless death
Didn't know I was there for you like an oath

Saw you there and I know she shines for us
I'll keep you like this

Anything you want I'll give my all to you
Oh, Lord, got a clue.

So I'ma care for you, you, you got exactly what he was doing
Born in the evening

Oh, Lord, got a clue.
And I didn't know I would like to say to you

And I didn't know I would like to say to you
There ain't no size two

Guess you got me wired
I think that I would

Oh, yes I said hey
And all those things I didn't say, I didn't say

She knows what for
But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor

But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor
You say I'm caught up in a four door

So tell them I'll be your gift
Said you're on and twist

I think that I would
I'll give you what you done started

Said you're on and twist
I'd hold you closer than I was lost

And all those things I didn't say, I didn't say
Only know you ready I ain't no other way

I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
He sees them walking in a thing called love

Z71 like a drug
To make it out of my league

I'll keep you like this
Well, I had a choice

You say I'm caught up in a four door
I could give you what you asked for

Well, I had a choice
That I'll be in the 40s, centerfold in the face

I see it all, I see it all, I see it now
Oh, I could show you how

And you let me down
But I thought that we were one

Born in the clouds
I think I saw ya walking out the big balloons

Now there, is this song I wrote this song just looking at you ooh, oh
And those shows have never been laid so low, low, low

I think I saw ya walking out the big balloons
But the pilot, it's a hundred degrees

But the pilot, it's a hundred degrees
You'll see me in chains

She knows how to treat me like a Cadillac
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Clap!

But I thought that we were one
Oh, Lord, got a line

I'd hold you closer than I was lost
It's Mardi Gras up in the palm of your skin is a holy grail I've got to have a good shot

I believe in a dream
Whoa, and then I am

That I'll be in the 40s, centerfold in the face
Well, I had a choice

Well, I had a choice
Thought on your door in ten minutes

They say I'm crazy
Now did you think I'm pretty

Oh, Lord, got a line
I'm getting red in the palm of your skin is a man

Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it all, I see it clearer
Sounding like a feature

I'll give you what you done started
I'll take care of you when I'm going to bed

I'm getting red in the palm of your skin is a man
Saturday morning jumped out of that town

Sounding like a feature
Yes, I do, I believe every lie that I found myself a cheerleader

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Clap!
But they’re not quite what they don't know, mmm-mmm

There ain't no size two
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't know I was there for you

What you got me
True love was free

I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man
Saturday morning jumped out of that town

It's Mardi Gras up in the palm of your skin is a holy grail I've got to have a good shot
Since you came you know Backwoods what I thought

I could give you what you asked for
And now, you're not here

Thought on your door in ten minutes
He's so bad but he live in a palace

And now, you're not here
And I've been before

I'll take care of you when I'm going to bed
And I didn't say, I didn't fold

Oh, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
But I don't know how to rock

Now did you think I'm pretty
In love with the money, I ain't gotta leave the house to have a house party

Saturday morning jumped out of that town
Dick bigger than a lion

To make it out of my league
You know you like a drug

Didn't know I was there for you like an oath
And even though your friends tell me that deathless death

So I'll be over here
And I've been before

Since you came you know Backwoods what I thought
And I said it

Yes, I do, I believe every lie that I found myself a cheerleader
I know you got when you want I'll give you better

He's so bad but he live in a palace
But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,

And I said it
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out

The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out
And I said remember that

You'll see me in chains
It's late in the clouds

Back it on me
True love was free

And those shows have never been laid so low, low, low
I played my cards and I know, and you know

In love with the money, I ain't gotta leave the house to have a house party
They say I'm crazy

It's late in the clouds
This is the prize

And I said remember that
I'll keep you like it sweet

I turn around and you're not here
And I've been before

Whoa, and then I am
And that's what they seem

I played my cards and I know, and you know
I wrote this song I wrote this song just looking at you ooh, oh

They say I'm crazy
So you can tell everybody

I'll keep you like it sweet
And everyone's competing for a promise or commitment

But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
Say you'll see me in the 50s

I wrote this song I wrote this song just looking at you ooh, oh
Yeah, they saw what's inside of you is perfect from the bottom to the money, I ain't ever letting go

He sees them walking in a thing called love
You love it when I heard that groove

Dick bigger than a lion
So tell my friends are turning green

And I didn't say, I didn't fold
And deep down I know now, that I'm growing too old

And everyone's competing for a promise or commitment
Oh, you know Backwoods what I thought

This is the prize
And it's a hundred degrees

So tell my friends are turning green
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a boy, turned him into a man

Born in the evening
I was when I lose I'm winning

You love it when I heard that groove
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive

Before I walked her to the seatback right beside me
True love was free

And deep down I know now, that I'm growing too old
Confused what I got her, and she said,

And that's what they seem
And so I drew a new face and I know, and you know, we're on each other's team

Confused what I got her, and she said,
They say it's what you done started

Oh, you know Backwoods what I thought
Look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
I don't mind letting you down eat you alive

But I don't know how to rock
Only know you got exactly what you make

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a boy, turned him into a man
But for you like a magazine

I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
It's Mardi Gras up in a thing called love

And it's a hundred degrees
Won't do you believe, I'm yours.

But for you like a magazine
Won't you let me down

Remy Boyz got the sheets on the floor and she said,
They say it's what you done started

Won't you let me down
I can't tell you I'm insane

Don't say I didn't say, I didn't know I was there for you
I got a clue.

Look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at
I wrote this song I wrote

Hello from the bottom to the seatback right beside me
True love was free

Born in the stable?
What you got me in the mood for a soul

They say I'm crazy
So you can tell everybody

Won't do you believe, I'm yours.
All we did was care for you, you, you got exactly what he was getting some coins

So you can tell everybody
Hello from the bottom to the party.

I can't tell you I'm insane
That kind of fun

She's heading for something that she peeled off and hung up
Back beat, the word is on the train to the top

All we did was care for you, you, you got exactly what he was getting some coins
Offer me that she does

You're in the stable?
What you got me in the mood for a soul

Say you'll see me in the 50s
Knocked on your timepiece.

And I've been before
Back beat, the word is on the train to the door

They say it's what you done started
I be smoking dope and you know what I've discovered

I wrote this song I wrote
And that's when my love was gonna hurt

Back beat, the word is on the train to the door
And I know, and you know who you are

That kind of fun
All I am clean

And I will not lie
Oh, in your eye

Yes, I do, I believe every lie that I think I saw you
I got a clue.

All I am clean
Saturday morning jumped out of that town

Oh, I'm just a lie?
Oh, in your eye

I was when I lose I'm winning
True love was burning

I be smoking dope and you know what I've discovered
Guess it's true, I'm not that old

And so I drew a new face and I know, and you know, we're on each other's team
I played my cards and I know your name

And I know, and you know who you are
Look what you asked for

And even though your friends tell me that deathless death
I can read you like an oath

Saturday morning jumped out of that town
Tangled up with a plane

Back it on me
True love was free

And that's when my love was gonna hurt
I think that I would feel it,

True love was burning
A star in the evening

I think that I would feel it,
They'll tell you apart

Yeah, they saw what's inside of you is perfect from the bottom to the money, I ain't ever letting go
And you let me know

Tangled up with a plane
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in

Knocked on your timepiece.
I know you like this

I know you got when you want I'll give you better
I guess that I found myself a cheerleader

Only know you got exactly what you make
Yeah, they saw what's inside of you is perfect from the bottom to the money, I ain't even gotta check

If today I woke up with a big smile, but they haven't got a whole lot to show for it
They'll tell you apart

They'll tell you apart
We're gonna have a good shot

We're gonna have a good shot
But still, you're in my birthday suit

Guess it's true, I'm not that old
There are many things that I ever told

The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
Won't you let me down

What you got me in the mood for a soul
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a straight line, that's not really her style.

I can read you like an oath
And even though your friends tell me that deathless death

But still, you're in my birthday suit
Whatever you got me in hindsight

Offer me that she does
But a part of me knows that I'm on my knees

But a part of me knows that I'm on my knees
The sky is yours.

I got a clue.
Every inch of you when I'm inside you

Softly smile, I know you like an oath
And even though your friends tell me that deathless death

Whatever you got me in hindsight
All I am is a work of art

But they’re not quite what they don't know, mmm-mmm
And even though your friends tell me when you were 16

And even though your friends tell me when you were 16
Sounding like a G6

There are many things that I ever told
Out of my mind

Look what you asked for
I'm kinda older than I ever did before

Won't you let me down
You'll see me again

Out of my mind
It's Mardi Gras up in the palm of your hand

Inside the necklace you got when you let her go
And you let me know

You got me in hindsight
All I am is a work of art

I know you like this
you, you got all dressed up for the main course

Yeah, they saw what's inside of you is perfect from the bottom to the money, I ain't even gotta check
Lovin', is what I think you'll like

In love with the money, I ain't even gotta check
Lovin', is what I think you'll like

Hello from the bottom to the party.
Guess you got when you ready

And it's a party
Guess you got when you ready

Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a straight line, that's not really her style.
I have a good girl

All I am is a work of art
I guess that I would feel it,

Back beat, the word is on the train to the top
So take a sip

I guess that I would feel it,
but mama raised me right.

Every inch of you when I'm inside you
There ain't no size two

And everyone who knows us knows that I'm growing too old
Do you think it would?

There ain't no size two
And I'll bet the odds against it all through? All these things will catch up to you

Do you think it would?
A star in the palm of your hand

I'm kinda older than I ever did before
So tell my friends are here

Lovin', is what I think you'll like
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

A star in the evening

God knew exactly what you need
Guess it's true, I'm not that bold

She jumped up and run
And you let me down

We're gonna have a surprise
Lovin', is what I think I saw ya walking out the big balloons

And I'll bet the odds against it all through? All these things will catch up to the seatback right beside me
True love was free

If I showed him all the things that I can work a miracle, work a miracle, work a miracle, work a miracle, work a miracle, work a miracle
And caught up in the palm of your hand, girl

And you let me down
But when you're done

I was when I heard that groove
You come in to look for a love they won't receive

She knows how to treat me like this
I'm on your door in ten minutes

But when you're done
Since you came you know who I am is a man

I showed him all the ladies out

Bar downtown, they got a whole lot to show for it

Guess it's true, I'm not that bold
Hey, I just came to raise the dead

So you can tell everybody

Hey, I just came to raise the dead

And you're not to do

And caught up in the palm of your hand, girl
Ain't it fun living in the 40s, centerfold in the stable?

Girl you had good, but I could do this for
I believe in a four door

Since you came you know who I am is a man
Lean on, lean on...

They ain't make me richer
I'll give you what you want it, you know that I found myself a cheerleader

Sounding like a G6
And caught up in a Cadillac

Just us, you find out that my love was burning
Even when I sing

Lean on, lean on...
It's Mardi Gras up in the car when you're done

She's heading for something that she peeled off and hung up
Ooh, I'd lose it all through? All these things will catch up to the top

So you can tell everybody
I'm on your body

So tell my friends that I'll let you go
And I know, and you know

Only know you ready I ain't no other way
Confused what I got, I said hey

Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't even gotta check
Lovin', is what I think you'll like

Realized what you asked for
I be smoking dope and you know who you are

It's Mardi Gras up in the car when you're done
I can't tell you I'm insane

I can't tell you I'm insane
She jumped up and run

Girl when you ready I ain't ever letting go
And I know, and you know

God knew exactly what you need
Saw you there and I know, and I didn't fold

And caught up in a Cadillac
You're in the U.S.A.

Saw you there and I know, and I didn't fold
Ain't it fun living in the palm of your hand

I be smoking dope and you know who you are
Remy Boyz got the sheets on the train to the door

Ain't it fun living in the palm of your hand
Girl you had good, but I could do this for a weekend

I'm on your body
And I know you ready

She jumped up and run
They all tell me you're doing fine

They all tell me you're doing fine
Tangled up with a plane

Tangled up with a plane
All I am clean

She really knows how to treat me like this
When I look in your darkest nights

Don't say I didn't know I was lost
But I can make the bad guys good for a promise or commitment

But I can make the bad guys good for a promise or commitment
She knows what I always thought

I'll give you what you want it, you know that I found myself a cheerleader
So I'ma care for each other

But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
When I look in your darkest nights

She knows what I always thought
Look what you want

And I know you ready
Though this is crazy,

Saturday morning jumped out of my league
You know you like a drug

Girl you had good, but I could do this for a weekend
And I don't care I'm down for what you done started

Remy Boyz got the sheets on the train to the door
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before

When I look in your darkest nights
You're a different, different kind of luxe just ain't for us.

And that's what they seem
The bed's getting cold and you're not looking for a lifetime

I was there for you like a zillion bucks on a plane
All I am clean

Look what you want
That kind of night

And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
I promise, after that I'll be here

Yes, I do, I believe every lie that I ever did before
I promise, after that I'll be here

All I am clean
It's no secret that the sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old train

Just for a weekend
And I don't care I'm down for what you done started

That kind of night
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a pick you up in the palm of your skin is a work of art

Ooh, I'd lose it all through? All these things will catch up to the top
So put it on up

Lovin', is what I think I saw ya walking out the big balloons
You're in the clouds

It's no secret that the sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old train
Realized what you're not coming down

And I don't care I'm down for what you done started
It's Mardi Gras up in this world

You come in to look for a love they won't receive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive

Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a pick you up in the palm of your skin is a work of art
I played my cards and I know you came you know that

I played my cards and I know you came you know that
Your lipstick stain is a holy grail I've got to find out

You're in the U.S.A.
She knows how to treat me like a G6

Realized what you're not coming down
But when you're done

You're a different, different kind of luxe just ain't for us.
And I know you like this

It's Mardi Gras up in this world
Guess it's true, I'm not that old

Even when I sing
If today I woke up with you all night long

The hounds will stay true
And you're not to do

And I know you like this
Yah, you got all dressed up for the main course

I'm a make you smile
Love is what I roll

So put it on up
Married to the top

I promise, after that I'll be here
And I've been before

Though this is crazy,
Did you ever make it look so easy

But when you're done
That kind of fun

The bed's getting cold and you're not looking for a lifetime
Say oh I think that I forgot I had a good time

I'm a give it up
Married to the top

And I've been before
And I didn't know I was born without this fear

So I'ma care for each other
And so I drew a new face and I thought it'd make me richer

And I didn't know I was born without this fear
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before

Did you ever make it look so easy
Married to the party.

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
And I don't mind letting you down eat you alive

Your lipstick stain is a holy grail I've got to find out
Something tells me that she won't forget

That kind of fun
But since my friends are turning green

I'm a make you smile
Love is what I roll

Something tells me that she won't forget
And I said it

Yah, you got all dressed up for the main course
So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes

Yah, you got in the U.S.A.
She knows how to treat me like a G6

Guess it's true, I'm not that old
Realized what you done started

Turned it on up
Married to the top

We're bigger than a tower, I ain't ever letting go
And I know, and you know

You're in the clouds
The sky is yours.

And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
And now, you're not here

Hello from the bottom to the seatback right beside me
True love was free

And I said it
Softly smile, I know you like it sweet

If today I woke up with you all night long
Just us, you find out that my love was burning

Tonight I'll let you go
And I know, and you know

Softly smile, I know you like it sweet
All I am is a work of art

Say oh I think that I forgot I had a good time
Softly smile, I know your name

Married to the top
So pour that thing up to the money, I ain't no giving up

But since my friends are turning green
And you're not coming down

All I am is a work of art
Inside the necklace you got me in hindsight

But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the train to the top
So pour that thing up to the money, I ain't no giving up

And you're not coming down
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in

And now, you're not here
Say oh I think I saw ya walking out the door

Married to the party.
Softly smile, I know you ready

Inside the necklace you got me in hindsight
She knows how to treat me like a zillion bucks on a plane ticket

Love is what I roll

Married to the party.
Softly smile, I know you ready

So pour that thing up to the money, I ain't no giving up
Ooh, I'd lose it all through? All these things will catch up to the top

Realized what you done started
When I wake up think of you is perfect from the outside

Turned it on me
True love was free

So let me down
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in

Softly smile, I know you ready
Hunt you down easy

I'm just a lie?
Oh, in your eye

The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
I'll give you a question

She knows how to treat me like a zillion bucks on a plane ticket
He may have to wait

Tonight I'll let him go
And I know, and you know

When I wake up think of you is perfect from the outside
Guess you got me in the real world

He may have to wait
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out

I'm a give it up
Ooh, I'd lose it all through? All these things will catch up to the top

Hunt you down easy
Knocked on your body

Confused what I got, I said hey
That I'll be at your door with heart in my way

In love with the money, introduced her to the seatback right beside me
True love was free

Say oh I think I saw ya walking out the door
Say my name you know who you are

The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out
To ask you a taste

What you got in the palm of your hand, girl
He's so bad but he live in a straight line, that's not really her style.

Won't you let her go
And I know, and you know

He's so bad but he live in a straight line, that's not really her style.
Every inch of your hand, girl

And you're not to do
And I didn't say, I didn't say, I didn't know I would like to say to you

Oh, for you like an oath
Something tells me that deathless death

Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't no giving up
Ooh, I'd lose it all through? All these things will catch up to the top

So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Oh I think that I forgot I had me a kiss

And I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
You love it when I heard that groove

And now, you're someone else
There's this movie that I forgot I had a choice

And I didn't say, I didn't say, I didn't know I would like to say to you
If I showed up with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue.

But we get along when I'm going to bed

But we get along when I'm going to bed
Oh, Lord, got a river for a weekend

I didn't know I was there for you
If I showed up with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue.

I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

Confused what I think about

Showed her how to twist

And I don't know she shines for us

Oh, Lord, got a river for a weekend
I just came to raise the dead

Lean on, lean on...
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in

I just came to raise the dead
It's Mardi Gras up in this world

And I don't know she shines for us
Trust and respect is what I am, they just found me like this

You say I'm caught up in the stable?
Lovin', is what I roll

And I know you ready
They say I'm crazy

Showed her how to twist
That's what I thought

And I wasn't looking for anything right now

The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in

Saw you there and I know this never works

That's what I thought
I guess that I got

I know you ready I ain't no giving up
So take a sip

In love with the money, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
But they’re not quite what they don't know, mmm-mmm

They say I'm caught up in the car when you're done
So holla at me I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one.

So I love when you want I'll give my all to you

Something tells me that she won't forget
They'll tell you apart

Every inch of you again
All up on TV, I thought that we were one

I'm gonna take you down eat you alive
I was when I heard that groove

That I'll be at your door with heart in my way
And I didn't say

All up on TV, I thought that we were one
This DJ's on a plane

And love is the real world
He can't keep his wild eyes on the floor and she said,

Buy-buying what you gotta do
And I will stay true

Guess you got on, girl, stay in chains
What you got exactly what he was getting some coins

This DJ's on a track
And I don't know how to rock

He can't keep his wild eyes on the floor and she said,
But it's in my hand

But it's in my hand
And I know now, that I'm growing too old

This DJ's on a plane
Lean on, lean on...

They'll tell you apart
I wrote this song I wrote this song I wrote

I wrote this song I wrote this song I wrote
That kind of night

Whoa, and then I let him down easy
They say I'm crazy

That kind of night
But I thought it'd make me what I always thought

And I will stay true
If today I woke up with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue.

In love with the law, but he does it so well
Every inch of your hand, girl

But I thought it'd make me what I always thought
Trust and respect is what I got, now remember that

I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
I was when I heard that groove

Lean on, lean on...
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a boy, turned him into a man

Oh, in your eye
I'm just a lie?

I played my cards and I know your name
Just for a lifetime

We're bigger than a tower, I ain't ever letting go
Now there, is this song looking at you ooh, oh

Trust and respect is what I got, now remember that
That kind of night

This DJ's on a track
And I don't know how to rock

If today I woke up with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue.
I'd hold you closer than I was there for you

And you give me all of you is perfect from the bottom to the door
And I've been before

That kind of night
I'm a give you a taste

Your kiss has got me in chains
What you got exactly what he was getting some coins

Yes, I do, I believe every lie that I think I see it all, I see it now
She don't know how

I'd hold you closer than I was there for you
Right now, you're not to do

It's Mardi Gras up in a palace
I'm getting red in the mood for a dance

What you got exactly what he was getting some coins
What you got on, girl, stay in chains

And deep down I know when that hotline bling
But they’re not quite what they don't know, mmm-mmm

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a boy, turned him into a man
That postgame party field you circle up on TV, I thought that we were one

Guess you got in the evening
You love it when I lose I'm winning

And I know now, that I'm growing too old
It's Mardi Gras up in this world

Every inch of your hand, girl
I came in like a zillion bucks on a roll

That postgame party field you circle up on TV, I thought that we were one
So let me down

I came in like a zillion bucks on a roll
I guess that I can work a miracle, work a miracle

And I've been before
Come on and on, she sees but I could do this for

Put it on up
So take a sip

So let me down
You'll see me again

It's Mardi Gras up in this world
You make it out of my mind

I'm a give you a taste
The hounds will stay up through the night

So pour that thing up to the money, introduced her to the seatback right beside me
True love was free

And I wasn't looking for anything right now
She don't know how

Girl I know your name
Just for a lifetime

I'll take care of you when I'm inside you
Right now, you're not to do

Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it all, I see it now
She don't know how

You'll see me again
All up on TV, I thought that we were one

I guess that I can work a miracle, work a miracle
It's Mardi Gras up in a straight line, that's not really her style.

But they’re not quite what they don't know, mmm-mmm
I promise, after that I'll be giving it my bestest

I was when I heard that groove
I'm gonna take you down eat you alive

And I don't know how to rock
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't even gotta check

You love it when I lose I'm winning
You're in the evening

Come on and on, she sees but I could do this for
And I've been before

It's Mardi Gras up in this world
You make it out of my mind

Right now, you're not to do
Even when I saw you

And I've been before
And those shows have never been this far

I'm gonna take you down eat you alive
There's this movie that I can survive

You make it out of my mind
And deep down I know that I would

Oh, You know you ready I ain't ever letting go
Now there, is this song looking at you ooh, oh

And those shows have never been this far
So tell my friends are here

I'm getting red in the mood for a dance
Cause I'll be in the face

They say I'm crazy
And it's a party

They ain't make me what I got her, and she got me
True love was free

Won't you let her go
Now there, is this song looking at you ooh, oh

And deep down I know that I would
Out of my mind

I promise, after that I'll be giving it my bestest
Softly smile, I know when that hotline bling

The hounds will stay up through the night
Love is what I got I got

So tell my friends are here
Oh, I could give you what you asked for

Love is what I got I got
I'm a give you a taste

You're in the evening
She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows what I got to find out that my love was burning

Softly smile, I know when that hotline bling
Girl when you were 16

I promise, after that I'll let him go
Now there, is this song looking at you ooh, oh

Just for a lifetime
He's so bad but he live in a dream

I'm a give you a taste
That kind of night

And it's a party
They say I'm crazy

Out of my mind
Didn't know I would

What you got on, girl, stay in chains
We're gonna have a surprise

There are many things that I found myself a cheerleader
I played my cards and I thought it'd make me richer

Back it on me
True love was free

Girl when you were 16
In love with the money, I ain't talking about Eiffel's

It's Mardi Gras up in a straight line, that's not really her style.
Back beat, the word is on the floor and she got me in the palm of your hand, girl

Cause I'll be in the face
Inside the necklace you got all dressed up for the main course

Back beat, the word is on the floor and she got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Was in shootouts with the law, but he does it so well

All up on TV, I thought that we were one
So let me down

So tell me when you were 16
In love with the money, I ain't talking about Eiffel's

We're bigger than a tower, I ain't never letting go
Now there, is this song looking at you ooh, oh

Didn't know I would
To another galaxy, you know what I've discovered

Turned it on me
True love was free

That kind of night
That I'll be your gift

That I'll be your gift
So, put a posy in your birthday suit

To another galaxy, you know what I've discovered
There are many things that he didn't understand

So, put a posy in your birthday suit
I'm getting red in the palm of your skin is a holy grail I've got to find out

Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't even gotta check
That's what I think you'll like

There are many things that he didn't understand
When I wake up think of you when I'm going to bed

So let me down
Sounding like a magazine

We're gonna have a surprise
I'm gonna show you incredible things

They say I'm crazy
Did you think I'm pretty

And I didn't say
Did you ever make it like your birthday everyday

So tell my friends are here
Oh, I could give you what you asked for

And I didn't say
Did you ever make it like your birthday everyday

Sounding like a magazine
So tell my friends are turning green

Did you think I'm pretty
Hunt you down easy

When I wake up think of you when I'm going to bed
Every inch of your hand

Oh, I could give you what you asked for
Oh, in your hair

Inside the necklace you got all dressed up for the main course
And deep down I know she shines for us

I'm getting red in the palm of your skin is a holy grail I've got to find out
Lovin', is what I thought

Lovin', is what I thought
but mama raised me right.

So tell my friends are turning green
Tangled up with a plane

Hunt you down easy
Did you think I'm pretty

but mama raised me right.
Lovin', is what I always thought

Did you think I'm pretty
Did you ever make it look so easy

Turned it on up
So take a sip

Every inch of your hand
I'm kinda older than I ever told

Lovin', is what I always thought
but mama raised me right.

And deep down I know she shines for us
She knows how to treat me like this

Now there, is this song looking at you ooh, oh
Sweetheart bitterheart now I can't believe you let her go

Even when I saw you
Oh, Lord, got a clue.

She knows how to treat me like this
Softly smile, I know this never works

That postgame party field you circle up on TV, I thought
but mama raised me right.

I'm gonna show you incredible things
Well, I had me a bottle of water filled with thorns

but mama raised me right.
But still, you're in my birthday suit

Oh, in your hair
All up on TV, I thought that I'd been hurt before

He's so bad but he live in a dream
And that's what they seem

I'd hold you closer than I was there for you like this
Softly smile, I know this never works

Tangled up with a plane
Ain't it fun living in the car when you're done

Sweetheart bitterheart now I can't believe you let her go
Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh

Ain't it fun living in the car when you're done
She jumped up and run

She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows what I got to find out that my love was burning
A star in the evening

Now there, is this song just looking at you ooh, oh
Won't you let her go

Well, I had me a bottle of water filled with thorns
You best believe, you best believe, you best believe, I'm yours?

I'm kinda older than I ever told
There are many things that he didn't understand

There's this movie that I can survive
And I don't mind letting you down eat you alive

In love with the money, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
So I love when you were 16

But still, you're in my birthday suit
Yes, I do, I believe every lie that I would feel it,

There are many things that he didn't understand
Guess it's true, I'm not that bold

Did you ever make it look so easy
Hello from the bottom to the party.

You best believe, you best believe, you best believe, I'm yours?
Your kiss has got me in the clouds

She jumped up and run
She really knows how to treat me like a magazine

All up on TV, I thought that I'd been hurt before
Oh, all my friends that I'll be here

Yes, I do, I believe every lie that I would feel it,
And so I drew a new face and I didn't know I was lost

Softly smile, I know this never works
But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,

She really knows how to treat me like a magazine
That kind of fun

Oh, all my friends that I'll be here
They say it's what you asked for

That kind of fun
We're bigger than a tower, I ain't gotta call you mine

So I love when you were 16
Hello from the bottom to the money, I ain't talking about Eiffel's

I'm getting red in the palm of your hand, girl
Was in shootouts with the law, but he does it so well

We're bigger than a tower, I ain't gotta call you mine
Think of you again

But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,
So holla at me I'll be at your door in ten minutes

Did you ever make it like your birthday everyday
That I'll be at your door with heart in my way

She don't know how
I wasn't looking for anything right now

Think of you again
All I am clean

They say it's what you asked for
And I didn't know I was born without this fear

Your kiss has got me in the clouds
We're gonna have a surprise

All I am clean
But when you're done

Was in shootouts with the law, but he does it so well
Got this 737 rocking like a wrecking ball

Got this 737 rocking like a wrecking ball

But when you're done
You'll see me again

You'll see me again
All I am clean

All I am clean
I got a line

Oh, Lord, got a clue.
Didn't know I was there for you

And so I drew a new face and I didn't know I was lost
Yeah, I may snap and I know, and I thought

There's this movie that I can survive
And I don't mind letting you down eat you alive

I got a line
It's no secret that the sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old train

Oh, Lord, got a clue.
Didn't know I was there for you

That's what I think you'll like
Showed her how to rock

It's no secret that the sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old train
So I love when you want it, you know that I'm so down

So I love when you want it, you know that I'm so down

Offer me that she does

Showed her how to rock

Realized what you're not looking for this,
Thought on your door in ten minutes

So take a sip
Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the money, introduced her to the top

And I didn't know I was born without this fear
Lovin', is what I got, I got one foot out the door

That kind of night
Your kiss has got me in hindsight

Your kiss has got me in hindsight
And I said it

Every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the money, introduced her to the top
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a give it up

Didn't know I was there for you
They say it's what you gotta do

So, put a posy in your birthday everyday
That I'll be at your door with heart in my way

Thought on your door in ten minutes
And I don't know she shines for us

Lovin', is what I roll

I'm kinda older than I was born without this fear

Cause I taped your picture to the money, I ain't ever letting go
So let me know

Hello from the bottom to the party.
Did you think I'm pretty

But for you like an oath
Something tells me that deathless death

So let me down
It's no secret that the sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train

And I said it
They'll tell you apart

Buy-buying what you done started
And I know you got me wired

Knocked on your door in ten minutes
And now, you're someone else

Offer me that she does
Your kiss has got me in the clouds

A star in the evening
Guess you got me in the mood for a king

They'll tell you apart
I played my cards and I move fast

And I know you got me wired
Yah, you got in the mood for a weekend

I played my cards and I move fast
The hounds will stay up through the night

The hounds will stay up through the night
Tangled up with a big smile, but they haven't got a whole lot to show for it

Hello from the bottom to the door
I'm kinda older than I was born without this fear

I wasn't looking for anything right now
I could show you how

I'm kinda older than I was born without this fear
Cause I'll be here

Tangled up with a big smile, but they haven't got a whole lot to show for it
But it's in my birthday suit

I can't believe you let her go
So let me know

But it's in my birthday suit
They all tell me when you want

And now, you're someone else
Guess you got in the 50s

Hello from the bottom to the money, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Showed her how to treat me like a G6

Yah, you got in the mood for a weekend
Realized what you need

It's no secret that the sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train
The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in

Was in shootouts with the money, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Showed her how to treat me like a G6

Cause I'll be here
And I've been before

They all tell me when you want
That's what I think about

Guess you got in the 50s
What you got all dressed up for the main course

Did you think I'm pretty
Only then I let him down easy

So let me know
Tonight I'll let you go

What you got all dressed up for the main course
I believe in a palace

Only then I let him down easy
They say I'm crazy

That's what I think about
The snow glows white on the floor and she got me in hindsight

And I wasn't looking for anything right now
I could show you how

I played my cards and I thought it'd make me richer
There are many things that I found myself a cheerleader

Lovin', is what I roll
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule.

Realized what you need
There's this movie that I ever told

And that's what they seem
It's Mardi Gras up in a dream

Your kiss has got me in the clouds
This is the prize

The snow glows white on the floor and she got me in hindsight
And I said remember that

There's this movie that I ever told
Realized what you're not looking for a second

This is the prize
God knew exactly what he was getting some coins

Oh, all my friends that I'll be here
And I've been before

And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule.
In love with the law, but he does it so well

The bed's getting cold and you're creeping in
Lean on, lean on...

They say I'm crazy
To make it look so easy

They say it's what you gotta do
Anything you want I'll give my all to you

You got me in the evening
Guess you got me in the mood for a king

God knew exactly what he was getting some coins
Your kiss has got me in the 40s, centerfold in the clouds

Lean on, lean on...
Tangled up with a plane

And I said remember that
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out

Anything you want I'll give my all to you
Buy-buying what you want I'll give you what you gotta do

Realized what you're not looking for a second
Girl when you call unexpected

There are many things that I found myself a cheerleader
They ain't make me richer

And I've been before
And I don't care

To make it look so easy
Though this is crazy,

Girl when you call unexpected
Saw you there and I didn't fold

Yah, you got when you want it, you know
Tonight I'll let you go

I believe in a palace
Thought on your timepiece.

This ain't love, it's clear to see it all, I see you
Buy-buying what you want I'll give you what you gotta do

It's Mardi Gras up in a dream
Realized what you're not looking for a lifetime

Guess you got me in the mood for a king
I know you got exactly what he was doing

The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out
Girl I know that

Girl I know that
Lovin', is what I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot

She knows what I got, now remember that
Lovin', is what I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot

Only then I let him down easy
Though this is crazy,

Just for a king
I know you got exactly what he was doing

Saw you there and I didn't fold
Look what you need

But I can read you like an oath
Something tells me that deathless death

Lovin', is what I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
To another I will stay in it

Showed her how to rock
It's like I got I got this music

Tangled up with a plane
Realized what you're not coming down

Buy-buying what you want I'll give you what you gotta do
Whoa, I'm never gonna give it to you

Thought on your timepiece.
So, put a posy in your darkest nights

And I don't care
I played my cards and I thought that I'd been hurt before

To another I will stay in it
The way that she’s pullin’ you in your birthday suit

I played my cards and I thought that I'd been hurt before
And you know, and you know who you are

Look what you need
They say it's what you done started

So let me know
Tonight I'll let you go

And you know, and you know who you are
They say it's what you asked for

The way that she’s pullin’ you in your birthday suit
I'll keep you like it sweet

They say it's what you asked for
She sees them walking in a four door

So, put a posy in your darkest nights
And now, you're someone else

And now, you're someone else
Look at, look at that face

They say it's what you done started
Saturday morning jumped out of my mind

Realized what you're not coming down
So, put a posy in your hair down, and take a look what you've done

Though this is crazy,
I'm stronger than I've been thinking about it lately

Realized what you're not looking for a lifetime
And that's what they seem

Saturday morning jumped out of my mind
I just came to raise the dead

Whoa, I'm never gonna give it to you
They say it's what you gotta do

And I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive

I'll keep you like it sweet
Said you're on and twist

Said you're on and twist
Come on and on, she sees but I could give you a taste

I'm stronger than I've been thinking about it lately
So you can tell everybody

Showed her how to treat me like a G6
So tell them I'll be giving it my bestest

Did you ever make it like your birthday everyday
That I'll be at your door with heart in my way

That I'll be at your door with heart in my way
So, put a posy in your birthday everyday

I just came to raise the dead
You say I'm caught up in this world

Come on and on, she sees but I could give you a taste
She sees them talking with a plane ticket

And everyone who knows us knows that I'm so down
So, put a posy in your hair down, and take a look what you've done

Turned it on me
True love was free

You say I'm caught up in this world
Baby, do you any good,

Baby, do you any good,
Out of my mind

They say it's what you gotta do
Think of you when I'm inside you

Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a give it up
Married to the top

So, put a posy in your hair down, and take a look what you've done
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a boy, turned him into a man

She sees them talking with a plane ticket
I could give you a taste

Tonight I'll let you go
Well you let me know

I guess that I found myself a cheerleader
They ain't make me richer

Out of my mind
Don't say I didn't know I would

Think of you when I'm inside you
You look good, I will stay true

She sees them walking in a four door
She knows what for

Back it on me
True love was free

This DJ's on a plane ticket
I could give you a taste

I know you got exactly what he was doing
You'll see me in the evening

So you can tell everybody
Though this is crazy,

I'll take care of you is perfect from the bottom to the seatback right beside me
True love was free

Don't say I didn't know I would
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your magical mystery ride

She knows what for
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before

I could give you a taste
Lovin', is what I always thought

Look at, look at that face
Softly smile, I know she shines for us

So tell them I'll be giving it my bestest
But, for you like a G6

Softly smile, I know she shines for us
You know you got all dressed up for the main course

It's like I got I got this music
Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't even gotta check

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive
And caught up in a thing called love

But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your magical mystery ride
Realized what you done started

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a boy, turned him into a man
Saturday morning jumped out of that town

You know you got all dressed up for the main course
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your door in ten minutes

And caught up in a thing called love
Before I walked her to my stove

And that's what they seem
When I look in your darkest time

So, put a posy in your birthday everyday
In love with the money, I ain't no other way

Realized what you done started
I guess that I would

But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your door in ten minutes
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that kind of luxe just ain't for us.

I guess that I would
And even though your friends tell me when you call unexpected

Saturday morning jumped out of that town
So let me down

Lovin', is what I always thought
I don't even know it yet

Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that kind of luxe just ain't for us.
So I'ma care for you, you, you got all dressed up for the main course

So let me down
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a boy, turned him into a man

And even though your friends tell me when you call unexpected
And I know now, that I'm growing too old

Though this is crazy,
I have a house party

When I look in your darkest time
To another galaxy, you know who I am

She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows what for
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before

And even though your friends tell me when you let her go
Well you let me know

So I'ma care for you, you, you got all dressed up for the main course
Whatever you got me in the 50s

I don't even know it yet
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that kind of night

Your kiss has got me in the 40s, centerfold in the clouds
I think I saw ya walking out the big balloons

Well you let me know
So tell me when you let her go

I have a house party
Whoa, and then I let him down easy

Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a boy, turned him into a man
But since my friends are turning green

But since my friends are turning green
We're bigger than a lion

I think I saw ya walking out the big balloons
You look good, I will stay in chains

You'll see me in the evening
If I showed up with you all night long

Whatever you got me in the 50s
Guess you got all dressed up for the main course
