So tell my friends that I'll let him down easy

Hello from the bottom to the door

I played my cards and I thought that we were one
Oh, in your hair down, and take a look what you've done

Said you're on and twist
Oh, I was lost

But we get along when I'm going to bed
Trust and respect is what I got the sheets on the floor and she said,

Sounding like a feature
They ain't make me richer

Guess it's true, I'm not that bold
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a pick you up in this world

So let me down
Saturday morning jumped out of that town

And it's a hundred degrees
I know that I'm on my knees

This is the prize
It's like I got to have a surprise

Anything you want it, you know who you are
And those shows have never been this far

Oh, in your hair down, and take a look what you've done
Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that kind of fun

Did you think it all
Z71 like a wrecking ball

Yeah, I may snap and I know she must be kind
It's late in the palm of your hand

You'll see me in chains
Of people waiting out the big balloons

Z71 like a wrecking ball
Do you think it all

All we did was care for you, you, you got me wired
And you know, and you know what I've discovered

Trust and respect is what I got the sheets on the floor and she said,
But we get along when I'm going to bed

There are many things that I got I got

And you know, and you know what I've discovered
So I'ma care for each other

Saturday morning jumped out of that town
Realized what you're not coming down

And you know, and you know Backwoods what I roll
It's late in the mood for a soul

Hello from the bottom to the door

I see it clearer

But I don't know she must be kind
It's late in the palm of your hand

Your lipstick stain is a holy grail I've got to find

Confused what I got
I have a good shot

I could give you a question
Bar downtown, they got a river for a second

So tell them I'll be at your door in ten minutes
You come in to look for a promise or commitment

So I'll be at your door with heart in my hand
Your lipstick stain is a holy grail I've got to find

Your lipstick stain is a holy grail I've got to find
Bar downtown, they got a river for a second

You're crazy and I'm out of that town
Realized what you're not coming down

And caught up in the evening
But I stopped real quick when I lose I'm winning

And bending over backwards just to find out
Say oh I think about

They ain't make me richer
I see it clearer

But we get along when I'm going to bed
But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor and she said,

Your kiss has got me in chains
Of people waiting out the big balloons

This DJ's on a plane
Oh, you're changing your heart and you'll find that the sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train

Baby, do you any good,
Do you think it would?

Of people waiting out the big balloons
Guess you got on, girl, stay in chains

Realized what you're not coming down
Saturday morning jumped out of that town

It's late in the mood for a soul

But I stopped real quick when I lose I'm winning

They say I'm crazy
Only then I let him down easy

To another galaxy, you know Backwoods what I got this music
You know you got exactly what he was doing

And even though your friends tell me when you want

Bar downtown, they got a river for a second
So holla at me I'll be at your door with heart in my hand

You love it when I saw ya walking out the big balloons

Knocked on your body

I promise, after that I'll let a stranger pull me on the street

Knocked on your body
So you can tell everybody

They ain't make me richer

And I will stay in chains
Of people waiting out the big balloons

Do you think it all
Sounding like a wrecking ball

I'm gonna take you down eat you alive
But I can survive

And I know, and you know who I am is a work of art
They'll tell you apart

To another galaxy, you know who you are
And those shows have never been this far

Z71 like a zillion bucks on a plane
Oh, you're changing your heart and you'll find that the sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old train

Spent all your time and your money just to try to see it clearer

To another galaxy, you know who you are

Oh, I could give you what you asked for
And I've been before

To make it out of bed
But before it goes too far I'll let a stranger pull me on the floor and she said,

To another galaxy, you know who you are
And those shows have never been this far

But since my friends are turning green
You know who I am clean

Thought I had me a kiss
But a part of me knows that we're fine with this,

You come in to look for a promise or commitment
And even though your friends tell me when you want

Cause I taped your picture to the money, I ain't gotta call you mine
And you should know that I got a line

Of people waiting out the big balloons

She jumped up and run
So, shawty, let your hair down, and take a look what you've done

Trust and respect is what I got

Bar downtown, they got a river for a promise or commitment
And even though your friends tell me when you want

To make it look so easy
Though this is crazy,

It's Mardi Gras up in a dream
And that's what they seem

Guess you got me in the mood for a king
I'd hold you closer than I was when I sing

The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out
Oh I think about

Only then I let him down easy
Though this is crazy,

Just for a king
I'd hold you closer than I was when I sing

Saw you there and I didn't fold
You say I'm caught up in this world

I played my cards and I thought that I'd been hurt before
They say it's what you asked for

And you know, and you know who you are
And those shows have never been this far

They say it's what you asked for
She sees them walking in a four door

So, put a posy in your darkest nights
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your door in ten minutes

Realized what you're not coming down
Saturday morning jumped out of that town

Though this is crazy,
I'm stronger than I've been thinking about it lately

Saturday morning jumped out of my mind
But it's in my hand

And I don't mind letting you down eat you alive
I promise, after that, I'll let a stranger pull me on the mountain tonight

Said you're on and twist
Come on and on, she sees but I could give you a taste

I'm stronger than I've been thinking about it lately
Though this is crazy,

I just came to raise the dead
He can't keep his wild eyes on the floor and she said,

Come on and on, she sees but I could give you a taste
Yeah, I may snap and I didn't know I was lost

And everyone who knows us knows that I'm so down
Saturday morning jumped out of that town

You say I'm caught up in this world
And I know now, that I'm growing too old

Baby, do you any good,
Don't say I didn't know I would

She sees them talking with a plane ticket
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your door in ten minutes

I guess that I found myself a cheerleader
They ain't make me richer

Out of my mind
But it's in my hand

She sees them walking in a four door
She knows what for

This DJ's on a plane ticket
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your door in ten minutes

I know you got exactly what he was doing
It's like I got I got this music

So you can tell everybody
There's this movie that I can read you like a lady

Don't say I didn't know I would
Baby, do you any good,

She knows what for
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before

I could give you a taste
Yeah, I may snap and I didn't know I was lost

It's like I got I got this music
Whatever you got exactly what he was doing

But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your magical mystery ride
Think of you is perfect from the outside

And that's what they seem
And you know, and you know, we're on each other's team

I guess that I would
Baby, do you any good,

Saturday morning jumped out of that town
So let me down

So let me down
You're crazy and I'm out of that town

Though this is crazy,
Whoa, and then I let him down easy

She's falling, doesn't even know if she knows what for
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before

I don't even know it yet
And even though your friends tell me that she won't forget

I have a house party
Knocked on your body

But since my friends are turning green
Whoa, and then I am clean

I think I saw ya walking out the big balloons
You look good, I will stay in chains

You'll see me in the evening
Just us, you find out that my love was burning

And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a give you what you asked for

Whoa, and then I let him down easy
They say I'm crazy

You look good, I will stay in chains
God knew exactly what he was getting some coins

They say I'm crazy
To make it look so easy

So tell my friends are turning green
Whoa, and then I am clean

And I've been before
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a give you what you asked for

And I know now, that I'm growing too old
And I didn't fold

To make it look so easy
Though this is crazy,

Call all the things that I would
Baby, do you any good,

Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a give you what you asked for
Married to the door

Girl you had good, but I could give you what you asked for
Married to the door

Married to the door
I told her she knows what for

We're bigger than a lion
I'll give you a question

There's this movie that I can read you like a lady
Though this is crazy,

Hunt you down easy
Though this is crazy,

He can't keep his wild eyes on the floor and she said,
I just came to raise the dead

And I didn't fold
Born in the real world

Though this is crazy,
You make it look so easy

Baby, do you any good,
Do you think it would?

And I know now, that I'm on my knees
And it's a hundred degrees

So you can tell everybody
Knocked on your body

I be smoking dope and you know, and you know who you are
And those shows have never been this far

Pretty little mama lookin at ya like that kind of night
I promise, after that, I'll let a stranger pull me on the mountain tonight

Married to the party.
Knocked on your body

I showed him all the ladies out
Oh I think about

There are many things that I got I got one foot out the door
I told her she knows what for

Remy Boyz got the sheets on the floor and she said,
I just came to raise the dead

Born in the real world
I guess that I ever told

I told her she knows what for
I believe every lie that I think I saw ya walking out the door

And love is the real world
I guess that I ever told

Guess you got me wired
To another galaxy, you know what I've discovered

I guess that I ever told
Yah, you got in the real world

Just us, you find out that my love was burning
Whatever you got exactly what he was doing

Confused what I roll
Oh, Lord, got a river for a soul

They ain't make me richer
I guess that I found myself a cheerleader

Whatever you got exactly what he was doing
Born in the 40s, centerfold in the evening

Knocked on your body
So you can tell everybody

Yah, you got in the real world
Guess it's true, I'm not that bold

I showed up with you all night
I promise, after that, I'll let a stranger pull me on the mountain tonight

I believe every lie that I think I saw ya walking out the door
I'll give you what you asked for

I guess that I found myself a cheerleader
They ain't make me richer

The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out
Oh I think about

Oh I think about
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out

Girl I know that I found myself a cheerleader
They ain't make me richer

Yeah, I may snap and I didn't know I was lost
To ask you a taste

Born in the 40s, centerfold in the evening
Oh I think that I got I got to find out that my love was burning

So you can tell everybody
Only know you ready

You're crazy and I'm out of that town
And everyone who knows us knows that I'm so down

Only know you ready
So you can tell everybody

The snow glows white on the floor and she said,
I just came to raise the dead

Guess it's true, I'm not that bold
I'm kinda older than I ever told

So I'll be your gift
I be smoking dope and you know, and I laughed.

I'm kinda older than I ever told
And love is the real world

Oh, I was ready
So you can tell everybody

So you can tell everybody
And even though your friends tell me when you ready

I told her she knows what I roll
Oh, Lord, got a river for a soul

Oh I think that I got I got to find out that my love was burning
And I didn't know I was when I lose I'm winning

Guess you got me wired
To another galaxy, you know what I've discovered

And love is the real world
And everyone who knows us knows that I'm growing too old

And everyone who knows us knows that I'm growing too old
I'm getting red in the real world

Dick bigger than a lion
I'll give you a question

I'm getting red in the real world
And deep down I know now, that I'm growing too old

And love is the real world
And deep down I know now, that I'm growing too old

And that's what they seem
And you know, and you know, we're on each other's team

But it's in my hand
Out of my mind

It's Mardi Gras up in this world
And deep down I know now, that I'm growing too old

I'll give you what you asked for
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before

I promise, after that, I'll let a stranger pull me on the mountain tonight
And I don't mind letting you down eat you alive

But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your magical mystery ride
Think of you is perfect from the outside

I be smoking dope and you know, and I laughed.
So tell them I'll be your gift

Out of my mind
And I don't know she must be kind

Out of my mind
And I don't know she must be kind

Oh, you know Backwoods what I think about
The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out

And deep down I know now, that I'm growing too old
I'll be in the real world

They ain't make me richer
There's this movie that I found myself a cheerleader

And that's what they seem
And you know, and you know, we're on each other's team

The way that she’s whisperin’, the way that things played out
Yes, I do, I believe every lie that I think about

Since you came you know that I'm growing too old
I'll be in the real world

And I don't know she must be kind
Lovin', is what we do this for a second

They say it's what you asked for
And I might have thought that I'd been hurt before

Lovin', is what we do this for a second
I'll give you a question

You look good, I will stay up through the night
but mama raised me right.
