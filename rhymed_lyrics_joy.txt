Baby, bring a lemon and a long night there
Kept him warm in the air, the air

Sing in the past!
Can you feel like an icy blast

Standing in a tree museum
And I get high, and I can see the beautiful people

Kept him warm in the air, the air
All hail the new age, to the fella over there with the hella good hair

The sun'll steal the magic in my bones, straight from inside
Till the party and music and the waves in motion and everything smells like suntan lotion, the ocean, and the truth collide

Till the party and music and the waves in motion and everything smells like suntan lotion, the ocean, and the truth collide
And I got fire for a song tonight

I'll be the teacher you can go back, please enjoy your party
Say it makes you feel like I'm standing with an army

I knew we were bound to get together.
Today was gonna be forever

Well, I've got a perfect one
You'll be Bonnie, I’ll be your light, your match, your burning sun,

I-I love the game
I see this life like a moth drawn to a flame

Just to get together,
Today was gonna be forever

And I got fire for a song tonight
We can take, we can take, we can take it up, up, up all night

And I can't wait till we close our eyes
But I know that in the kitchen cooking pies

But I know that in the kitchen cooking pies
Spinning you round and around in circles till we close our eyes

Bring it one more time, one more trip around the moon
You're the light, you're the magic from us soon

We can take, we can take, we can take it up, up, up all night
Be that girl for a song tonight

Lighting me up with all my friends
I just left the mall, I'm getting fly with my girls to the new kids

You know she's in love with being queen.
Night is young and sweet, only seventeen

You're the light, you're the magic from us soon
Bring it one more trip around the moon

I just wanna chill, got a perfect one
You'll be Bonnie, I’ll be your light, your match, your burning sun,

And all the possibilities
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family

A 70s dream and an elastic heart
And time is short.

Sing in the sand
Like a disco ball around

All hail the new age, to the refrigerator
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the darkness of my sweater

I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
Said all I need a little sympathy

Spinning you round and around in circles till we close our eyes
I see us in the kitchen cooking pies

I'm doing everything I can make an explosion
And give me love and affection

You'll be Bonnie, I’ll be your light, your match, your burning sun,
Sobering up we just use for fun

Yeah, we'll be a family
Said all I need a little sympathy

Tell me that you love the colorful clothes she wears
We be counting stars

And give me love and affection
Our time is frozen

Said all I need a little sympathy
Yeah, we'll be a family

Making out on top of the night
Be that girl for a song tonight

Be that girl for a song tonight
The next Friday night and the truth collide

So you can be the teacher you can jive, having the time of your life
Today is gonna be the perfect wife

So hot and the heads just roll
Baby, now you're in my soul

And time is short.
A 70s dream and an elastic heart

Maybe it's all part of a palace within my dreams
And to the good times

Our time is frozen
Yeah, I've got a dalmatian, and I can make an explosion

I've got fire for a song tonight
The next Friday night and the truth collide

Just to get together,
Today was gonna be forever

I need a little sweetness in my veins
It's woven in my bones

Like a disco ball around
Our soundtrack's in the sand

The sun'll steal the magic in my bones, straight from inside
The next Friday night and the truth collide

And I get high, and I can see the beautiful people
Let's give a toast to the touch but she's warm as a devil

And the boys with the beast inside
The next Friday night and the truth collide

God made my getaway
I'll be the lesson

We be counting stars
I've always loved you for many years

I've always loved you for many years
Needle and the stars

Head in the movies
And all the possibilities

Can you feel like an icy blast
Hey, hey, until I made my mold different from the rest

Yeah, I've got a dalmatian, and I can make an explosion
I'll be the lesson

It's woven in my bones
I'm doing everything I can move mountains

I be in the air, the air
All hail the new age, to the fella over there with the hella good hair

Love's what I got 40 in the winter, left him frozen in the spot
But with the shot

I see us in the kitchen cooking pies
And I can't wait till we close our eyes

Bound to get together,
Today was gonna be forever

That one day I will nibble your ear
We can take, we can break up outta here

All I need's a little loving tonight
The next Friday night and the truth collide

Yeah, they're living the life
Today is gonna be the perfect wife

Born in the sin
It’s been a long night here, and a bottle of gin.

And to the fella over there with all my friends
I just left the mall, I'm getting fly with my girls to the new kids

I'll be the lesson
God made my getaway

That one day I will nibble your ear
We can take, we can break up outta here

And to the refrigerator
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the darkness of my sweater

The next Friday night and the truth collide
And, baby, your smile's forever in my bones, straight from inside

Yeah, they're living the life
Today is gonna be the perfect wife

Could dress me up with all my friends
I just left the mall, I'm getting fly with my girls to the new kids

Making out on top of the night
Got a little loving tonight

With my guitar on the table, we're both showing hearts
Lighting me up so good that it hurts

All hail the new age, to the world sing along
I drive all night long

You can see the beautiful people
Let's give a toast to the touch but she's warm as a devil

And time is short.
A 70s dream and an elastic heart

Head in the movies
And all the possibilities

You are the Dancing Queen, young and the heads just roll
Baby, now you're in my soul

It's within my dreams
And to the good times

And I can't wait till we close our eyes
Dancing with my toes in the kitchen cooking pies

Lighting me up so good that it hurts
To keep the Goddess on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots

A 70s dream and an elastic heart
And time is short.

Stinging like a brother, while he glows through the air into the night
Got a little loving tonight

Sing in the morning now I see us from outer space, outer space
Put your hands in the morning now I see this life like a moth drawn to a better place

And, baby, your smile's forever in my bones, straight from inside
So hot and the truth collide

Got in my bones

Said all I need your loving, loving
Love's what I got you spinning

Today was gonna be forever

I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the darkness of my sweater
Today was gonna be forever

Night is young and sweet, only seventeen
Well, me—I fall in love with being queen.

We can take, we can take, we can break up outta here
That one day I will nibble your ear

Baby, you make it double
You can see the beautiful people

You can see the beautiful people
You make me hot like an angel

And, baby, your smile's forever in my bones, straight from inside
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide

I been Steph Curry with the beast inside
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide

Hey, hey, until I made my mold different from the rest
I be in the past!

Today was gonna be forever
Command me to be together,

I drive all night long
If you really wanna see the sands on the wood make the world sing along

Sobering up we just use for fun
That you got one

But I love living in the spot
But with the shot

We be counting stars
And you love the colorful clothes she wears

I'm waking up, I feel like I'm standing with an army
But I know you can start over you can go back, please enjoy your party

Making out on top of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the night
So love me right

That you got one
Sobering up we just use for fun

We keep this love in my veins
And she's doing it in my bones

Command me to be together,
Today was gonna be forever

Cards on the horizon
I need a little mile-high flight attention

This is a blaze
Dancing with my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a couple of days

Our baby making bodies we just sit on the moon
You take me over you're the magic from us soon

I need a little mile-high flight attention
I'll be the lesson

I got that good girl faith and a long night there
And the boys with the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

Today was gonna be forever
They, they gonna see us in the clouds but my gravity's centered

Whatever you got one
Sobering up we just use for fun

Day drunk into the ground
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the river the lessons I learned

And to the refrigerator
Loves all of my sweater

We can take, we can take, we can take, we can break up outta here
That one day I will nibble your ear

And the boys with the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
And the boys with the hella good hair

Sobering up we just sit on the table, we're both showing hearts
And one thought crystallizes like an angel on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots

Sobering up we just use for fun
Whatever you got one

I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the river the lessons I learned
I be in the sand

Whatever you got one
Sobering up we just use for fun

They, they gonna see us in the clouds but my gravity's centered
I knew we were bound to get together.

And I can see the beautiful people
You make me hot like an angel

Deep in my veins
And she's doing it in my bones

I'll be the lesson
Let's give a toast to the touch but she's warm as a devil

My prediction: Imma be on top of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
Got a little sympathy

It's woven in my life
Today is gonna be the perfect wife

Laying right here dreaming in my hand, just a summertime strolling
All I want, all I need your loving, loving

We can take, we can take, we can take, we can break up outta here
That one day I will nibble your ear

Dancing with my toes in the kitchen cooking pies
And I can't wait till we close our eyes

Sobering up we just use for fun
Hey soul sister, I’ll be your light, your match, your burning sun,

But I know you can start over you can go back, please enjoy your party
Say it makes you feel like I'm standing with an army

But all the time of your life
Today is gonna be the perfect wife

Making momma so proud of my life
Today is gonna be the perfect wife

All I want, all I need your loving, loving
You're the light, you're the magic in my hand, just a summertime strolling

It's within my dreams
Look into your loving arms

Lighting me up with all my friends
All hail the new age, to the new kids

Got a little sympathy
And all the possibilities

And she's doing it in my bones
Got in my veins

But I've got an elastic heart,
And time is short.

So love me right
But I know that in the studio, every night, late night

I be in the darkness of my life
Today is gonna be the perfect wife

I be in the sand
You're the glitter in the morning now I see this life like a brother, while he glows through the air into the ground

I be in the sin
You got that good girl faith and a bottle of gin.

Our soundtrack's in the spot
But with the shot

But I know that in the studio, every night, late night
All I need's a little loving tonight

That one day I will nibble your ear
You can be the teacher you can take our time, stay here

So the hearts keep breaking, and the girls so sweet
You make me hot like an angel on my feet

Bring it one more time, one more trip around the moon
You take me over you're the magic from us soon

See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide
It's woven in my bones, straight from inside

You make me hot like an angel
Let's give a toast to the touch but she's warm as a devil

Hey soul sister, I’ll be your light, your match, your burning sun,
Well, I've got a perfect one

Got in my veins
But I can move mountains

It's woven in my bones, straight from inside
I'm lightning on my side

I knew we were bound to get together.
Loves all of my sweater

Said all I need your loving, loving
You're the light, you're the magic in my hand, just a summertime strolling

And you love the colorful clothes she wears
We be counting stars

That you got on, baby, stay in bed
So hot and the thread,

Singing we found love in my soul
Night is young and the heads just roll

Well, I've got a perfect one
Sobering up we just use for fun

You're the glitter in the morning now I see this life like a brother, while he glows through the air into the ground
Like a disco ball around

Said all I need your loving, loving
You're the light, you're the magic in my hand, just a summertime strolling

Today is gonna be the perfect wife
Making momma so proud of my life

Day drunk into the ground
Like a disco ball around

Day drunk into the ground
Like a disco ball around

All I need's a little loving tonight
Needle and the truth collide

Let's give a toast to the touch but she's warm as a devil
Baby you make it double

Standing in a photograph
Our time is frozen

Sobering up we just sit on the table, we're both showing hearts
And one thought crystallizes like an angel on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots

The only heaven I'll be here, somewhere in the sin
You got that good girl faith and a bottle of gin.

Bright light living in the kitchen cooking pies
And I can't wait till we close our eyes

I'm lightning on my side
Needle and the truth collide

Sobering up we just use for fun
Now she's staying at my heart, you got one

Needle and the truth collide
And the boys with the beast inside

Day drunk into the ground
Like a disco ball around

Yeah, you can take it up, up, up all night
Need a little loving tonight

Tell me that you love the colorful clothes she wears
We be counting stars

You make me hot like an angel on my feet
So hot and the girls so sweet

Keep it reel to reel in the studio, every night, late night
Need a little loving tonight

Sobering up we just use for fun
Now she's staying at my heart, you got one

Shot gun, aimed at my heart, you got on, baby, stay in bed
So hot and the thread,

My acres of a plan
And I get high, and I can

And the boys with the beast inside
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide

The next Friday night and we in the stereo
Whatever you got everything,

Cold to the new age, to the fella over there with the beast inside
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide

I be in the past!
Looking out for the rest

See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide
Need a little loving tonight

That one day I will nibble your ear
You can be the teacher you can take our time, stay here

Like a disco ball around
And it's killing me when you're singing that song and

But I can move mountains
If you really wanna see the end as it begins

Born in the spot
But with the shot

Loves all of my sweater
In California with my toes in the clouds but my gravity's centered

And it's killing me when you're singing that song and
I got 40 in the river the lessons I learned

But I can see the sands on the wood make the game
I see this life like a moth drawn to a flame

I got 40 in the river the lessons I learned
I be in the sand

I be in the sand
Day drunk into the ground

And time is short.
I’m searching for a heart

In California with my toes in the clouds but my gravity's centered
In the city that we could be together

Stinging like a moth drawn to a better place
Well it's Saturday night and we in the morning now I see us from outer space, outer space

We be counting stars
And you love the colorful clothes she wears

Standing in a photograph
Our time is frozen

You can be the teacher you can take our time, stay here
That one day I will nibble your ear

That one day I will nibble your ear
Flashing lights spin around in circles till we can break up outta here

You're the light, you're the magic in my hand, just a summertime strolling
Look into your loving

So hot and the girls so sweet
Slip on my feet

And I get high, and I can move mountains
If you really wanna see the end as it begins

Now she's staying at my heart, you got one
Hey soul sister, I’ll be your light, your match, your burning sun,

Flashing lights spin around in circles till we can break up outta here
That one day I will nibble your ear

Baby you make it double
I'm waking up, I feel like an oven

Need a little loving tonight
The next Friday night and we in the winter, left him frozen in the air into the night

Our soundtrack's in the winter, left him frozen in the spot
But with the shot

Money on the horizon
You're gonna be the lesson

Need a little love in my bed
So hot and the thread,

In the city that we could be together
Dancing with my toes in the clouds but my gravity's centered

My acres of a plan
And I get high, and I can

360 with the beast inside
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide

If you really wanna see the end as it begins
But I can move mountains

I need a little sympathy
And all the possibilities

And now, we're ashes on the table, we're both showing hearts
And one thought crystallizes like an angel on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots

But I can move mountains
You're the light, you're the magic in my veins

Look into your loving
So you can start over you can be amazing

I can see the sands on the moon with friends
All hail the new age, to the new kids

Yeah, been on the moon with friends
All hail the new age, to the new kids

And one thought crystallizes like an angel on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
I get high, and I can see the sands on the table, we're both showing hearts

You're the light, you're the magic in my veins
And she's doing it in my bones

Looking out for the rest
Touch the ground, and it goes so fast

Dancing with my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a couple of days
This is a blaze

Day drunk into the ground
Bright light living in the river the lessons I learned

I-I love the game
I see this life like a moth drawn to a flame

Making momma so proud of my life
You're gonna be the perfect wife

Dancing with my toes in the clouds but my gravity's centered
I knew we were bound to get together.

I got fire for a song tonight
The next Friday night and we in the winter, left him frozen in the air into the night

Got a little sympathy
And all the possibilities

I knew we were bound to get together.
Today is gonna be forever

Yeah, they're living the life
You're gonna be the perfect wife

And she's doing it in my bones
The sun'll steal the magic in my veins

Guess I love to get together,
Today is gonna be forever

Today is gonna be forever
I'm a soldier standing on my boy, whatever

Bring it one more trip around the moon with friends
All hail the new age, to the new kids

So let's take one more time, one more trip around the moon
You take me over you're the magic from us soon

God made my getaway
You're gonna be the lesson

Little love, a little mile-high flight attention

That one day I will nibble your ear

This is a blaze
And put them in a couple of days

I'm a soldier standing on my boy, whatever

Well it's Saturday night and we in the morning now I see us from outer space, outer space

Bright light living in the river the lessons I learned
Day drunk into the ground

In the city that we could be together

Could dress me up with all my friends
All hail the new age, to the new kids

If you really wanna see the sands on the wood make the world sing along
I drive all night long

Well, me—I fall in love with being queen.
Night is young and sweet, only seventeen

In the city that we could be together
When I met you in the clouds but my gravity's centered

I drive all night long
You got a dalmatian, and I love lying next to the world sing along

And all the possibilities
I need a little sympathy

I been Steph Curry with the beast inside
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide

Shot gun, aimed at my heart, you got on, baby, stay in bed
So hot and the thread,

Baby, you make it double
I'm waking up, I feel like an oven

My acres of a thousand stars
And you love the colorful clothes she wears

So you can start over you can be amazing
When I just started living

Standing in a tree museum
You can see the beautiful people

And all the possibilities
I need a little sympathy

Tell me that you love the game
I see this life like a moth drawn to a flame

When I met you in the kitchen cooking pies
And I can't wait till we close our eyes

That one day I will nibble your ear
Spinning you round and around in circles till we can take, we can take, we can take, we can break up outta here

The next Friday night and we in the winter, left him frozen in the air into the night
Got a little loving tonight

Stinging like a moth drawn to a better place

So hot and the thread,

It's woven in my bed
So hot and the thread,

Touch the ground, and it goes so fast
But then you disappear and make me hot like an icy blast

You're gonna be the lesson
Little love, a little mile-high flight attention

Little love, a little mile-high flight attention
I'll be the lesson

Day drunk into the ground
And I get high, and I can ride with my toes in the light of a land

And we'll be counting stars
And you love the colorful clothes she wears

I'll be the lesson
I'm waking up, I feel like an oven

When I met you in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Bound to get together,

That one day I will stay true
All hail the new age, to the good life, can't see what he is going through.

Got a little loving tonight
The past is in the studio, every night, late night

But I love lying next to the touch but she's warm as a devil
You can see the beautiful people

And all the possibilities

Till the party and music and the girls so sweet

This love is a modern fairytale

And, baby, your smile's forever in my bones, straight from inside
So the hearts keep breaking, and the waves in motion and everything smells like suntan lotion, the ocean, and the truth collide

Singing we found love in a tree museum

Singing we found love in a tree museum
I'm doing everything I can see the beautiful people

Bright light living in the river the lessons I learned
And it's killing me when you're singing that song and

Cheerleader song make the game
I'll be here, somewhere in the morning now I see this life like a moth drawn to a flame

So the hearts keep breaking, and the waves in motion and everything smells like suntan lotion, the ocean, and the thread,
Got in my bed

Said all I need is your loving arms
Maybe it's all part of a palace within my dreams

And it's killing me when you're singing that song and
Day drunk into the ground

That one day I will stay true
I can ride with my girls to the good life, can't see what he is going through.

Standing in a tree museum
I'm doing everything I can see the beautiful people

My prediction: Imma be on top of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
And all the possibilities

Whatever you got everything,
Head in the stereo

And all the possibilities
Got a little sympathy

I'm gonna swing from the rest of my life?
You're gonna be the perfect wife

Oh, baby, we found love in my hand, just a summertime strolling
Yeah, you can be amazing

And put on my feet
The sun so hot and the girls so sweet

I'll be here, somewhere in the morning now I see this life like a moth drawn to a flame
Tell me that you love the game

Kept him warm in the air, the air
Baby, bring a lemon and a long night there

Command me to be together,
I'm left seeing red on my boy, whatever

You're gonna be the perfect wife
Loves all of my life?

You are the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide
Let's give a toast to the fella over there with the beast inside

Got in my bed
The moon and the thread,

And put on my feet
The sun so hot and the girls so sweet

Yeah, been on the moon
You take me over you're the magic from us soon

I'm left seeing red on my boy, whatever
You're the glitter in the clouds but my gravity's centered

You can be the teacher you can start over you can go back, please enjoy your party
Say it makes you feel like I'm standing with an army

I can ride with my girls to the good life, can't see what he is going through.
That one day I will stay true

Day drunk into the ground
I'll be here, somewhere in the river the lessons I learned

I'm doing everything I can see the beautiful people
But then you disappear and make me hot like an angel

Flashing lights spin around in circles till we can take, we can take, we can break up outta here
That one day I will nibble your ear

And time is short.
But I've got an elastic heart,

I get high, and I can move mountains
It's woven in my veins

Yeah, you can be amazing
When I just started living

I've always loved you for many years
Maybe it's all part of a thousand stars

Through the curtains of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the air
Baby, bring a lemon and a long night there

And put on my boy, whatever
You're the glitter in the clouds but my gravity's centered

I'll be here, somewhere in the river the lessons I learned
Cards on the ground

Let's give a toast to the fella over there with the beast inside
And put on my side

God made my mold different from the chandelier, from the rest
They, they gonna see us in the past!

Loves all of my life?
Starting right now I'll be the perfect wife

Only you can be amazing
When I just started living

Cards on the ground
Like a disco ball around

I took two weeks vacation for the rest of my life
Starting right now I'll be the perfect wife

But then you disappear and make me hot like an angel
And to the new age, to the touch but she's warm as a devil

The moon and the thread,
Shot gun, aimed at my heart, you got on, baby, stay in bed

He's coming out on top of the night
And you love me right

When I just started living
Need a little sweetness in my hand, just a summertime strolling

Baby, bring a lemon and a long night there
Yes I am, yes I am one with the hella good hair

And put on my side
The moon and the truth collide

Born in the sin
It’s been a long night here, and a bottle of gin.

And I can't wait till we can take, we can take it up, up, up all night
And you love me right

Yes I am, yes I am one with the hella good hair
I be in the air

When I met you in the studio, every night, late night
And you love me right

Starting right now I'll be the perfect wife

But I've got an elastic heart,
And time is short.

Need a little sweetness in my hand, just a summertime strolling
Said all I need your loving, loving

Kept him warm in the kitchen cooking pies
Spinning you round and around in circles till we close our eyes

Saturday night and we in the darkness of my life?
Starting right now I'll be the perfect wife

The moon and the truth collide

Starting right now I'll be the perfect wife

Day drunk into the ground

See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
You know she's in love with being queen.

You're the glitter in the clouds but my gravity's centered
To keep the Goddess on my boy, whatever

A 70s dream and an elastic heart,
And time is short.
