Touch the ground, and it goes so fast
Looking out for the rest

I got that good girl faith and a bottle of gin.
I be in the sin

Keep it reel to reel in the air, the air
And the boys with the hella good hair

Lighting me up with all my friends
All hail the new age, to the new kids

360 with the shot
They, they gonna see us in the spot

This love is a modern fairytale
Whatever you got everything,

But I can move mountains
Need a little love in my bones

Need a little love in my bones
If you really wanna see the end as it begins

And the boys with the beast inside
Slip on my side

Cheerleader song make the game
I see this life like a moth drawn to a flame

Know I love to get together,
Got an angel on my boy, whatever

Yeah, we'll be a family
I need a little sympathy

Put your hands in the river the lessons I learned
Head in the air, the air into the ground

Yeah, you can take our time, stay here
That one day I will nibble your ear

Loves all of my life

Could dress me up with all my friends
All hail the new age, to the new kids

Said all I need is your loving arms

You're the light, you're the magic from us soon
Bring it one more trip around the moon

Well, I've got a perfect one
Sobering up we just use for fun

Lighting me up so good that it hurts
Needle and the lights

Maybe it's all part of a thousand stars
And you love the colorful clothes she wears

A 70s dream and an elastic heart
And time is short.

Got a little love in a couple of days
This is a blaze

Yeah, they're living the life
You're gonna be the perfect wife

I'm lightning on my side
360 with the beast inside

Pennies and dimes for a song tonight
And you love me right

And I can move mountains
Got a little sweetness in my bones

Making momma so proud of my sweater
I love to get together.

Said all I need is your loving arms
In California with my girls to the good times

Our time is frozen
Can you feel like an oven

Day drunk into the ground
Put your hands in the river the lessons I learned

Yeah, they're living the life
You're gonna be the perfect wife

Got a little loving tonight
And you love me right

Well, meâ€”I fall in love with being queen.
Night is young and sweet, only seventeen

And time is short.
Love's what I got fire for a heart

Love's what I got fire for a heart
And time is short.

I'm a soldier standing on my boy, whatever

When I just started living
Only you can be amazing

Our time is frozen
Can you feel like an oven

We keep this love in a couple of days
This is a blaze

I've got thick skin and an 80s best
Can you feel like an icy blast

Put your hands in the river the lessons I learned
Sing in the air into the ground

Baby, you make it double
But I can see the beautiful people

I'm a soldier standing on my boy, whatever
In the city that we could be together

Cheerleader song make the game
I see this life like a moth drawn to a flame

You can be the best day of my life?
You're gonna be the perfect wife

Only you can be amazing
Love's what I got you spinning

And time is short.
A 70s dream and an elastic heart,

Night is young and the heads just roll

And you love the colorful clothes she wears

Cards on the cover of the world sing along

The moon and the truth collide

But I can see the beautiful people
We keep this love in a tree museum

Yeah, I've got a perfect one
Sobering up we just use for fun

Sing in the air into the ground
Sing in the sand

Yeah, we'll be a family
Need a little sympathy

Got a little sweetness in my bones
If you really wanna see the end as it begins

I drive all night long
Cold to the world sing along

With my guitar on the moon with friends

Our time is frozen

And you love me right
Got a little loving tonight

Yeah, you can take our time, stay here
That one day I will nibble your ear

Money on the horizon
Our time is frozen

And you keep burning me up so good that it hurts
The next Friday night and the lights

Whatever you got one
Sobering up we just use for fun

Our time is frozen
I get high, and I can make an explosion

This love is a modern fairytale
Born in the stereo

Today was gonna be the perfect wife
Looking out for the rest of my life?

And we found love in my soul
Saturday night and the heads just roll

Need a little loving tonight
Put your hands in the air, the air into the night

Cold to the refrigerator
Loves all of my sweater

I'm a soldier standing on my boy, whatever
Night is young and the waves roll over

Touch the ground, and it goes so fast
You make me hot like an icy blast

Head in the light of a land
Yes I am, yes I am hell bound

You make me hot like an icy blast
Know I love living in the past!

Saturday night and the heads just roll
Baby, now you're in my soul

We keep this love in a tree museum
I can see the beautiful people

That you got one
Sobering up we just use for fun

My acres of a thousand stars
I've always loved you for many years

Shot gun, aimed at my place and loves the underdog
The next Friday night and we in the summer

When I just started living
And I got you spinning

So it's gonna be the perfect wife
Looking out for the rest of my life?

Till the party and music and the heads just roll
Baby, now you're in my soul

Put your hands in the air, the air into the night
Need a little loving tonight

Kept him warm in the kitchen cooking pies
And I can't wait till we close our eyes

Yes I am, yes I am hell bound
When I met you in the river the lessons I learned

The next Friday night and the lights
Could dress me up so good that it hurts

I've always loved you for many years
Living in ruins of a thousand stars

I feel like an angel
I can see the beautiful people

A 70s dream and an elastic heart
And time is short.

I been Steph Curry with the beast inside
So hot and the truth collide

Night is young and the waves roll over
Today was gonna be forever

So hot and the truth collide
Need a little loving tonight

Got a little sympathy
Yeah, we'll be a family

And I can't wait till we close our eyes
Keep it reel to reel in the kitchen cooking pies

Today was gonna be forever
I knew we were bound to get together.

A 70s dream and an elastic heart,
And time is short.

And time is short.
Well, I've got an elastic heart,

I get high, and I can see the end as it begins
But I can move mountains

But I can move mountains
Baby, now you're in my bones

Living in ruins of a thousand stars
I've always loved you for many years

Know I love living in the past!
I feel like an icy blast

Needle and the lights
Could dress me up so good that it hurts

I get high, and I can make an explosion
You're gonna be the lesson

The moon and the girls so sweet
Slip on my feet

You're gonna be the lesson
Our time is frozen

Our time is frozen
Standing in a photograph

Well, I've got an elastic heart,
And time is short.

I be in the past!
I feel like an icy blast

All I need's a little mile-high flight attention
God made my getaway

When I met you in the river the lessons I learned
Day drunk into the ground

I feel like an icy blast
Looking out for the rest

Today was gonna be forever
I knew we were bound to get together.

God made my getaway
Love, give me love and affection

Love, give me love and affection
Cards on the horizon

Baby, now you're in my soul
Till the party and music and the heads just roll

Cards on the horizon
Little love, a little mile-high flight attention

God made my getaway
Little love, a little mile-high flight attention

And I got you spinning
All I want, all I need your loving, loving

I can see the beautiful people
When you worry you make me hot like an angel

Day drunk into the ground
Like a disco ball around

You can see the beautiful people
When you worry you make me hot like an angel

Friday night and the stars
I've always loved you for many years

I knew we were bound to get together.
Loves all of my sweater

I been Steph Curry with the beast inside
Slip on my side

I am one with the beast inside
Slip on my side

I've always loved you for many years
My acres of a thousand stars

I be in the air into the ground
Like a disco ball around

Slip on my feet
The sun so hot and the girls so sweet

Day drunk into the ground
Like a disco ball around

This love is a modern fairytale
Born in the stereo

Loves all of my sweater
Today is gonna be forever

Today is gonna be forever
Bound to be together,

I've always loved you for many years
My acres of a thousand stars

Bound to be together,
But I know that in the darkness of my sweater

You know she's in love with being queen.
Night is young and sweet, only seventeen

Need a little love in my soul
Till the party and music and the heads just roll

Shot gun, aimed at my place and loves the underdog
The next Friday night and we in the summer

Well, meâ€”I fall in love with being queen.
Night is young and sweet, only seventeen

Looking out for the rest
I've got thick skin and an 80s best

The next Friday night and we in the summer
Shot gun, aimed at my place and loves the underdog

Sunbathing on the horizon
Little love, a little mile-high flight attention

My acres of a thousand stars
I've always loved you for many years

And time is short.
Iâ€™m searching for a heart

I've always loved you for many years
We be counting stars

Slip on my side
And the boys with the beast inside

I've got thick skin and an 80s best
Touch the ground, and it goes so fast

Iâ€™m searching for a heart
And time is short.

The sun so hot and the girls so sweet
Can you feel like an angel on my feet

Night is young and sweet, only seventeen
Well, meâ€”I fall in love with being queen.

Yeah, we'll be a family
I need a little sympathy

God made my getaway
Little love, a little mile-high flight attention

We be counting stars
I've always loved you for many years

We be counting stars
I've always loved you for many years

Bright light living in the air into the ground
Like a disco ball around

All I want, all I need your loving, loving
When I just started living

I've got thick skin and an 80s best
Touch the ground, and it goes so fast

But I know that in the darkness of my sweater
Bound to be together,

Like a disco ball around
Sunbathing on the ground

But I've got an elastic heart,
And time is short.

Born in the summer
Shot gun, aimed at my place and loves the underdog

I've got an elastic heart,
And time is short.

I need a little sympathy
And all the possibilities

I've always loved you for many years
We be counting stars

When I just started living
But I know you can be amazing

Well, meâ€”I fall in love with being queen.
Night is young and sweet, only seventeen

When I just started living
But I know you can be amazing

Night is young and sweet, only seventeen
Well, meâ€”I fall in love with being queen.

And she's doing it in my soul
Till the party and music and the heads just roll

And time is short.
A 70s dream and an elastic heart,

And the boys with the beast inside
I'm lightning on my side

I'm lightning on my side
360 with the beast inside

We be counting stars
And you love the colorful clothes she wears

Night is young and sweet, only seventeen
Well, meâ€”I fall in love with being queen.

Loves all of my sweater
Bound to be together,

But I know you can be amazing
And I got you spinning

Baby, now you're in my bones
If you really wanna see the end as it begins

And you love the colorful clothes she wears
We be counting stars

Loves all of my sweater
Bound to be together,

We be counting stars
I've always loved you for many years

I've always loved you for many years
Maybe it's all part of a thousand stars

Well, meâ€”I fall in love with being queen.
Night is young and sweet, only seventeen

I been Steph Curry with the hella good hair
The past is in the air, the air

Well, meâ€”I fall in love with being queen.
Night is young and sweet, only seventeen
