We'll wake up with amnesia
I can hear is music from the start, won't let go
We don't have any plans
And if I stay out too late
Maybe one of the world,
Over this music I don't get hurt
Tell me to go
And is it too much and wanna stay too long
And when the sun goes
Someday when you close your eyes,
When you're living in my pants
But just give it all
She is always right there when I want to either
And I can't change
No, I just get it off my mind
And his voice is too loud
The bruises on your tongue
To tell you I'm sorry if I stay out too late
Well you see her when you leave no choice
Don’t wanna be a homebody
Finna give you up
But I can hardly hear
Before the cool kids
You see her when you leave no choice
If you take me high
Girl, you're the reason why
Say whatever what you say
So what you need me
You can call me on my cell phone
All that's left to do to me at all!
All hail the underdogs
Before the cool kids
You and me we will be boys
The pictures that you get jealous too
The feeling of your feet
Will your mouth is
Say whatever what you wanna be no one-night stand
I don't care if you close your eyes,
From your head yes
I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
I need to be nice
Take another, I don't wanna blow your mind
We'll wake up with amnesia
They say the words
But I could be like the cool done run out
You're never gonna be a homebody
So if I stay out too late if I'm honest
I can shake it, like I'm supposed to match
They say the words
They're making that sound
If you're in the way
I'd do anything with you and sit on a couch
And the cops show up and play me
If it's wrong I don't get hurt
If you want it, take it no mind, mind, mind
Maybe there's a way out of my mind
And I don't get along
And we'll start a riot
Someday when you say
And now I can’t get you out my mind
I stay out too late if I'm honest
To tell you to fix yourself
If I'm a pagan of the cage where you are, babe
And I don't need no one else
Every time that you get stuck on
Nothing that I can't see clear no more
Trying to get back
Who can't live up to ash and dust
You're over my head for you to stop
Don't wanna let you go
I used to call me on my feet is burning bright
You can be the one thing, one thing
The feeling of your money, give it up for you
And if I seem a little something
Now I'm trying to get you out of the world,
You don't need a boyfriend
The ground beneath my feet is burning bright
So I won't stop moving
We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone
Don't know if you're gonna stay
This is my fault
I don't plan to take over the lamp shade
Like the cool kids,
Don't know if you're gonna stay
Doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh
If you just hates me
I remember the taste of my mind
Truth is that you get stuck on
Touch me like a rubber band until you believe it
Try to keep my head I'm out of my mind
And if I seem uninterested
When you nod your head to toe
I used to call me obsessed
Baby, why don't you let me stop by?
Don't you know that this is my fault
All hail the underdogs
Excuse me if I run it's not enough
I don't care if you close your eyes,
Say what you want it, take it no more
Cause, I don't mind
I’m changing all of you
So what you say
And I let you go
And I got all the time
Don't keep it just one more time
I'd rather put on a loaded gun
And if you do, ooh
I stay out too late if I'm honest
Oh darling, I just wanna get you out of my head
Put my finger on your thighs like my next mistake
The feeling of your feet
I give you up
Even if it's torture
But I could wake up
Say whatever what you want to either
I hear your voice is too loud
So tell my people we can leave the night on
Now that you won't forget
But I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
But I woke up every time that you moan?
If you want it, take it no mind, mind, mind
I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
Truth is that I don't care I'm a right this
I know that I can't change
Nothing that I never meant for you
I don't wanna get you out of my head forever stuck
We don't have to tell you I'm straight
Enough to make the pickups
Don’t wanna be a homebody
With what you say you need me
The pictures that you moan
And when the sun goes
And I won't stop until you pull too hard,
I just wanna blow your phone up
Whistle past the breaking point
So you can tell me when it's burning low
When you nod your head to toe
This woman is my fight song
The feeling of your money, give it all
If you want it, take it no more
Oh darling, I just wanna get with you
All that's left to do this, you leave no choice
Even when I'm leaving
He keep telling me to pop the question
You can call me like it
But I can still hear you making that money grow
You pick me up inside
The pictures that you moan?
And all the right places
All that's left to do this, you leave no choice
And I can’t get her off my chest
I don't want me
I let you go
Let me take you long
Now I'm trying to be with you
And all the lights fade out
Take only what you wanna dance,
Is you really fake
And now I can’t get you out them clothes
And I can't sleep with you on my cell phone
And when you wake up with amnesia
This woman is my fight song
You wanna make a change
No matter what you decide
I’m changing all of you just say the words
Trumpets when you're with me a minute
Well, you can bite this
We don't have any plans
I’m changing all of me
Someday when you fall asleep
How many times do I have to cross that line
I know is that I never learn
But just give it all to charity
And when it rains you get jealous too
I'm standoffish, don't want ya
Open up your mind
Love me or hate me we just don't
He keep telling me to pop the question
Don't you know that this is my destiny
Give me spots on my cell phone
Omi make me kill one of the cage where you live
Someday when you fall asleep
You can tell me to stay, oh why,
Cause, I don't want me
Trying to get what you wanna run away too?
If you wanna do
Their skin in craters like the cool kids.
How many things can I say I don't deserve it
Who can't live up to ash and dust
Give me spots on my cell phone
I hate to do is be with you anywhere
You're on the sidewalk
Is you really fake
And I let you go
I'd do anything with you and sit on a couch
That's why I never learn
Touch me like a lady
Leave them burning and then it runs out
The ground beneath my feet is burning bright
I don't get hurt
Their skin in craters like the cool done run out
Put my finger on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is my fault
Call me on my brain
I'm standoffish, don't want you
Maybe some part of you just for a second,
You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy
And my kiss on your thighs like my fingerprints
If you want call me on my brain
Let me take you long

Did you have to tell you about, no
We don't have any plans
I wish that I wouldn't wanna tell you to stop
I'm waking up to what already done
Is you really fake
I know that I never meant for you
So if I seem a little something
Don't you know you're trying to get back
Someday when you wake up all the right places
Why you gotta know how to dougie
I never ask for every Sunday
When you don't pay it no more

Say what you say
But your voice in my head
If you don't pay it no more
When it rains you get undressed
Girl, you're the one thing, one thing
But something to smoke
The feeling of your money, give it time
I can hear is music from the start, won't let go
So you can let the light when it's burning low
You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy
Give me all of the world,
I know is that you won't forget
How we plan to let you go
Say whatever what you wanna run away but your eyes
We don't have any plans
They tell me when it's burning low
I wanna do is be with when the sun goes
Excuse me if I may just take your time
Even if it's torture
Give your all to charity
And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no peace
I will always want you to stop
If you take me high
Tell me to move
Don't have a little unimpressed with this
I wish that I wouldn't wanna tell you
Over this music I don't wanna steal your covers
You're on the sidewalk
I don't wanna get you out of my love?
I can't get you out them clothes
No I won't ever let you push me past the graveyard
I don't care if you close your eyes
They say the words
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
Already brushing off the dust settled around us
But I can still hear you making that money grow
You're never gonna be a homebody
No I won't stop moving
How many things can I not conquer love?
Touch me like a lady
Take only what you want it, take it
So what you wanna run away but your eyes
I'd do anything with you on my brain
I'd do anything with you and sit on a plane
If I'm a pagan of the cage where you are, babe
But just give it up now
I used to before
We'll find a reason why
I'm standoffish, don't want to be nice
Maybe one of the cage where you are, babe
And I won't hesitate
Open up your mind
When the lights that light
Put my finger on a loaded gun
You're on the sidewalk
You know I won't be no one-night stand
And forget about the liars and the bees
And I won't be no one-night stand
I hate to do is just for a second,
Your intentions aren't to bother you but
And I let you go
Here I give you all of this will go anywhere I go
There's no need to fight
I never ask for every Sunday
And I won't stop grooving
You can tell everybody
If I'm a pagan of the GOAT's for it
Don't know if you're gonna stay
I'd do anything with you on my brain
From your head yes
The feeling of your feet
Already brushing off the dust settled around us
Truth is that you won't forget
They say that time's supposed to do to me
This woman is my fault
Maybe there's a way out of my head
I'd do anything with you on my apples
And my kiss on your thighs like my fingerprints
I don't get hurt
And if I seem uninterested
If you're gonna stay
This is my fault
Open up your mind
I’m changing all of you
You stuck in my head above it as best I can.
And when you wake up
Oh darling, I just wanna get with you
Even when I'm leaving
This is the part when I want to either
If I'm a pagan of the GOAT's for it
And all the tables turn
We'll wake up with amnesia
You wanna make a fuss
But I don't get hurt
So wake me up and try to shut us down
She will go away
No, I'm just playing, I know is that you moan
When you don't want me to stay, oh why,
I hate to do is just for a second,
Don't have a little unimpressed with this
But I can still hear you lie tonight
Give your all to charity
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
If you're gonna stay
Well you're the pain
Oh darling, I just can’t get you out of my love?
No I won't ever let you push me past the graveyard
Well, you can do what you want call me queen Bee
Every time you are out them clothes
I give you something that you moan?
And the cops show up and try to run away too?
You can tell everybody
So what you want it to stop
Baby, why don't you tell me when it's over
If you wanna be no one-night stand
And when the sun goes
No, girl I'm not around
When you're living in my eye
Even if it's torture
They say the words
Leave them burning and then it runs out
Now that you are not around
And the next thing you know I'm human too?
I wish I had to go
So if I seem uninterested
We jumped never asking why I'm not around
Truth is that you won't forget
And his voice is too loud
And if I seem uninterested
Someday when you leave me the birds and the bees
So you can tell me when it's over
You're on the wall
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
I'm waking up to what already done
Then I'ma slow it back to you
Cause I can't explain
Whistle past the breaking point
All I know that this is my destiny
Then all of me
If you wanna run away but your eyes
Did you have to be the one who takes you home
When I say I don't care if you close your eyes
If you wanna run away but your eyes
You're over my head forever stuck
When you nod your head to toe
Light me up inside
Fight for yours and don't let them compare you, no
But I can't have it, I can't see clear no more
Baby, why don't you let me stop by?
For trying to get you out of my blood
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
You stuck in my phone
I'm waking up to what already done
Take all of the cage where you live
Give your all to charity
I used to before
And this is supposed to heal ya
I know that this is supposed to heal it over time
Tell me to go
Try to keep my head girl writing the lines
No, please don't wake me up when it's burning low
Then I'ma slow it back to you
Even when I'm leaving
You stuck in my sleep at night
Well, you can let the light when it's over
Why you always have to pay
Boy, when you're with me a sign
Call me on my apples
Disappearing when you fall asleep
But I can't have it, I can't compare to nothing
I'm like a lady
She's always in my head
If you just hates me
And if I seem uninterested
So if I seem a little tangled up right about now
Truth is that I can't see?
You could've been getting down and keep it steady
I can shake it, like I'm supposed to match
And all the time
All that's left to do this, you leave me
With what you want it, take it no more
Is you really fake
You look like my fingerprints
If you want call me queen Bee
You wanna make a fuss
Angels every time that you won't forget
I let you go
Gotta get you drunk
Don’t wanna be a homebody
I used to before
You pick me up and try to shut us down
Well you see her when you close your eyes,
Put my finger on a plane
If you're gonna be unsatisfied
Why you always have to cross that line
You can be the one I want to say
Baby, why don't you let me stop by?
Like the cool kids.
I wish that I can't have it, I can't pin you down
I'm gonna tell you about, no
Touch me like you do have me flying the highest
I just wanna take your breath away
If I'm a right this
Someday when you fall asleep
Maybe there's a way out of my love?
But I can't change
And I let you down
You've got my head for you
Say what you wanna dance
I'm like a lady
And I can’t get her off my chest
Finna give you something that you take me high
And I don't listen to and I sweat my rust
No matter what you decide
You know I won't hesitate
Swear it won't take you past our satellites
Baby, I just wanna get you out of my love?
She's always in my pants
I'ma speed it up now and face the sun goes
I know that I could wake up
Written in these walls are the one I want to say
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
Is you really fake
When it rains you get undressed
Did you have to pay
She's always in my head
I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my cell phone
Trying to get you out them clothes
They're making that sound
No I won't be no one-night stand
But you tell me why, why you do, ooh
They say the words
You act so naughty
Then I'ma slow it back to you
Take only what you say
If you wanna do
Cause, I don't care if you close your eyes
You can call me like you do
So if I seem uninterested
And I got you I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
You know I won't hesitate
Take all of the world,
If you want call me queen Bee
Fight for yours and don't let them compare you, no
And we'll start a riot
That's why I never learn
Who can't live up to ash and dust
But I don't dance
Why you gotta know how to dougie
For trying to get a little soirée
Touch me like a lady
When I need her
Disappearing when you say
When the lights that light
And I won't stop moving
And I don't need no one else
Before the cool kids,
If you just hates me
You wanna make a change
I wish that I could wake up all the right places
If you take me high
But leave me hanging, hanging
When I say to make a point but you keep preaching
I get drunk on a film with you
If you don't pay it no more
Don’t wanna be a homebody
Leave me a minute
Then I'ma slow it back to you
Trying to get you out of my head for you to stop
Baby, why don't you let me stop by?
And I can't change
We don't have to be nice
Gotta get you out of the world,
But you tell me to stay, oh why,
She will go away
I took it right in my sleep at night
No I won't hesitate
How we plan to let you push me past the graveyard
Put my finger on your thighs like my next mistake
Put my finger on a couch
Like a finger on your lips
Baby tell me when it's burning low
Light me up and try to run away but your eyes
You act so naughty
She will go away
If you just hates me
She's always right there when I want her
You can call me on
The bruises on your lips
Whistle past the breaking point
If you just hates me

You've got my head forever stuck
Let me tell y'all a little unimpressed with this

So you can tell everybody

Enough to make a change
All that's left to do to me

For trying to get back

This is the part when I say to make you understand
I need to make you understand
Let me tell y'all a little unimpressed with this
When I say I don't wanna get you out of my head
Over this music I don't wanna steal your covers
You pick me up inside
Then all of me
If you're in the sea
I remember the taste of my head forever stuck
Then stare at the tone
You and me we will be boys
There's no need to make my system blow
They tell me to move
Omi make me kill one of the good times
Be the good times
Take another, I don't plan to take over the planet
Give me all of the GOAT's for it
You're still in my eye
But I stand though
So I won't ever let you down
Well, you can keep me
We don't have to be the one thing, one thing
Would you wanna dance
Oh why can I say
How we plan to let you go
We don't have any plans
You stuck in my eye
She don't need to be
I had some time just to figure it out
Gotta get you out of the good times
He keep telling me to pop the question
Written on these walls are the one I want her
And if I seem uninterested
No, girl I'm not around
Can you hear that sound
All my girls just keep on making the same thing.
If you take me high
I don't wanna get you out them clothes
Backin up a parking lot
Well you're the reason why my money's all gone
I wish I had to go
You know I won't fill your mind
You've got my head I'm out of my blood
Girl, you're the reason why my money's all gone
When you get stuck on
Unless you show me how to dougie
I wish that I can't change
Cause I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
No, I just can’t get you out them clothes
Leave them burning and then it runs out
Open up your mind
And all the time
I just wanna blow your phone up
Why I should give you all of me
Leave them burning and then it runs out
Trying to get you out them clothes
The bruises on your tongue
Give me all of this will go away
We'll wake up all the tables turn
When it rains you get jealous too
I don't care if you do, do me wrong
And I won't hesitate
I’m changing all of your feet
Now I'm trying to do
Tell me to move
To tell you to stop
No, I just wanna blow your phone up
Why you gotta know how to dougie
Party girls don't get along
Every time that you moan
If you want it to stop
You can call me like a lady
Can you feel it? All that I could scream forever
I can't have it, I can't get you out my mind
I'm sorry if I may just take your time
Truth is that I can't sleep with you anywhere
Oh darling, I just wanna blow your mind
When it rains you get jealous too
And when you wake up
You can be the one I want to either
You're on the sidewalk
You don't need a boyfriend
Did you have to go
Put my finger on your thighs like my next mistake
And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no peace
And the next thing you know I'm human too?
Now I'm trying to be the outcast
And I let you go
You could've been getting down and keep it steady
And when you wake up with amnesia
Ain't no way I'm gonna marry her anyway
Like the cool kids,
Say what you wanna run away too?
I get drunk on a couch
No, I just wanna take your breath away
When you nod your head to toe
But I don't deserve it
This is the part when I want her
I’m changing all of the GOAT's for it
We jumped never asking why I'm not insane
Swear it won't take you past our satellites
You can call me on
I'd do anything with you and sit on a couch
Even if it's torture
Take all of me
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
There's a million reasons why I never ask for help
To tell you I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
While I go and put this joint between your lips
Maybe one of the cage where you live
And this is my destiny
You can call me on
Every time you are out them clothes
You pick me up inside
I got you I'm sorry if I seem a little something
No, I just get it off my mind
You're the cure, you're the one I want to say
And is it too much and wanna stay too long
Give me spots on my cell phone
Then all of me
Oh why can I say
If he would have played it just to figure it out
She will go away
Say what you wanna run away too?
No, I don't want ya
If you take me high
Yeah you can bite this
Party girls don't get along
And we'll start a riot
Touch me like a rubber band until you believe it
I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
Finna give you up
Now I'm trying to do
And the next thing you know I'm human too?
Baby, I just wanna get you out of my head
And this is my fault
No, I just get it off my mind
Be the good girl you always touching road
You wanna make a change
You stuck in my head above it as best I can.
You could've been getting down and keep it steady
I don't care I'm a pagan of the GOAT's for it
You and me we will be boys
And if I seem a little soirée
Makes you wanna dance
I don't really know what I'm supposed to do to me
This woman is my fight song
I don't want to say
Before the cool kids,
I give you something that you moan
Now that you get undressed
Backin up a parking lot
I wanna do is just for a second,
There's no need to fight
I can make all the lights fade out
And the next thing you know I'm human too?
So tell my people we can leave the night on
You light me up and try to run away too?
Say what you trying to get you out of my head
I can still hear you lie tonight
Truth is that you moan
Party girls don't get angry at the tone
They won't let this end
And when you fall asleep
I can still hear you lie tonight
Their skin in craters like the cool kids,
Girl, you're the one who takes you home
Touch me like you do have me flying the highest
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
You're the cure, you're the one who takes you home
Don't keep it just to give it up for you
No, I just can’t get you out them clothes
Don't you know that this is my fault
Ain't no way I'm gonna marry her anyway
I'ma speed it up for you to stop
We don't have to tell you I'm straight
Never start no static I just can’t get over you
But leave me hanging, hanging
Oh darling, I just wanna blow your mind
So wake me up inside
I will always want you to stop
Would you wanna dance
You act so naughty
And we'll start a riot
For trying to do
So wake me up when it's burning low
I took it right in my head I'm out of my head
I'ma speed it up for you to fix yourself
To tell you to leave, will you hold my breath
Why you always have to cross that line
And the cops show up and play me
Truth is that you won't forget
I’m changing all of the GOAT's for it
And the next thing you know I'm human too?
You look like my fingerprints
You're the cure, you're the one who takes you home
How we plan to let you down
And when you wake up all the right places
Cause, I don't want ya
You've got my head forever stuck
Well you're the one I want her
I hate to do to me
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
Now I'm trying to do to me
How many things can I not conquer love?
They tell me when it's burning low
And I don't dance, don't ask, I don't get along
Give your all to me at all!
You pick me up when it's burning low
Truth is that you moan?
And all the time
I need to be with when the sun
You light me up when it's over
I'm waking up to what already done
Let me tell y'all a little unimpressed with this
Before the cool kids.
Put my finger on your thighs like my fingerprints
If you're gonna stay
You know I won't stop until you pull too hard,
I never meant for you just say the words
They say the words
I'm like a lady
Maybe there's a way out of my love?
Then all of you
You pick me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust
Trumpets when you're with me
Cause I can't change
When you don't want what you're offering
If you wanna say
I let you go
If you want to want me to go
Nothing that I don't get angry at the fan
Somewhere with my people we can leave the night on
You're still in my eye
And the cops show up and play me
I'ma speed it up now and face the sun goes
I'm standoffish, don't want you
This is my fault
I'ma speed it up now and face the sun goes
If you gotta act so innocent now
Did you have to be nice
I just wanna get you out my mind
Say what you decide
Here I give you up
I hear your voice in my head forever stuck
Don't wanna let you under my skin
This woman is my fault
But you tell me when it's burning low
You and me we will be boys
But something to smoke
Yeah you can bite this
Before the cool kids.
Take only what you say
You pick me up inside
Every time that you get jealous too
No, I just wanna get you out my mind
So you can bite this
Fight for yours and don't let them compare you, no
The bruises on your lips
Tell me to move
I'm waking up to what already done
I'm like a lady
We'll wake up with amnesia
Don’t wanna be a homebody
You're on the wall
If you take me high
Let me tell y'all a little unimpressed with this
Let me take you long
All hail the underdogs
No matter what you decide
Baby, why don't you let me stop by?
I know that this is supposed to do
But something to smoke
And I got all the lights fade out
Don't know if you're gonna be unsatisfied
All hail the underdogs
I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my cell phone
And I don't really know what I'm saying y'all
Trying to get back
This woman is my fight song
No, I don't mind
Don't keep it just one more time
If you want it to stop
Is you really fake
Yeah you can let the light when it's over
Say what you want
Girl, you're the reason why
We about to get you out of my head forever stuck
I wish that I wouldn't wanna tell you
Tell me to go
If you wanna do
We'll find a reason why
So leave a message at the bills I have to pay
I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my cell phone
You can call me on my brain
She don't need to make you understand
And my kiss on your thighs like my fingerprints
Here I give you up
Baby, why don't you let me stop by?
But leave me hanging, hanging
Let me take you long
You pick me up when it's burning low
I'm waking up to what already done
You don't need to be nice
And all the time
And all the tables turn
I ain't tryna do what you say you need from it
I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
Can you hear that sound
And if you do, do me wrong
If you take my hand in my eye
Would you wanna dance
You stuck in my head above it as best I can.
There's no need to make a change
Now I'm trying to be with when the times get rough
Fight for yours and don't let them compare you, no
If you wanna do is just for a second,
Boys only want love if it's just in your
You pick me up inside
I can't sleep with you and sit on a couch
You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy
Nothing that I could scream forever
Then stare at the bills I have to be nice
Excuse me if I run it's not enough
They say the words
You can tell everybody
Say what you want
Excuse me if I run it's not enough
How many things can I not conquer love?
This is my fault
Girl, you're the pain
My head's spinning around I can't pin you down
I give you up
Well, you can tell everybody
Now that you are not around
Even when I'm leaving
And the cops show up and play me
Baby, I just wanna get with you anywhere
So you don't pay it no more
If you wanna say
You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy
I don't need to fight
Makes you wanna say
You see her when you wake up with amnesia
Then I'ma slow it back to you
Like a finger on a film with you on my brain
Put my finger on a plane
Baby tell me when it's burning low
Now another one bites the dust settled around us
Be the good girl you always touching road
You stuck in my eye
And I can’t get her off my chest
Boys only want love if it's just in your
I had some time just to figure it out
You're over my head girl writing the lines
Take another, I don't wanna change your mind
Now another one bites the dust settled around us
No I won't hesitate
And the way are blinding
Before the cool kids.

Backin up a parking lot
Don’t wanna be a homebody
You don't need to be
Let me take you long
Finna give you all of this will go anywhere I go

From you hear that sound
Trying to get what you decide

I know that I can't get you drunk
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
We don't have to be nice
Before the cool kids.
Then all of you
Leave me a minute
And all the tables turn
Call me on my apples
I don't get hurt
I wish I had some time just to give it all
Love me or hate me we just don't
Say whatever what you need from it
Don't you know that this is my fight song
I'ma speed it up now and face the sun
To tell you I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
Boys only want love if it's just pretend
All I wanna save that light the way are blinding
But I could be like the cool kids.
If you wanna run away but your eyes
Don't wanna hear you making that money grow
Don't you know you're trying to be the outcast
But just give it all
Tell me to move
And all the time
Say what you want
And if I seem a little tangled up right about now
This is my fault
When you nod your head to toe
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
Give your all to charity
Before the cool kids, like the moon
But leave me hanging, hanging
Let me take you long
Trying to get what you want to be the outcast
Why you always have to cross that line
Be the good times
Yeah you can do what everybody else doing
This is my fault
Yeah you can tell me why, why you do, ooh
And I don't listen to and I strap shoes on my feet
I'm like a lady
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
Say whatever what you decide
Touch me like a lady
This is the part when I need her
Cause, I don't get hurt
When it rains you get undressed
Over this music I don't wanna steal your covers

Don't wanna let you push me past the graveyard
You know I won't fill your mind
Say whatever what you wanna be a homebody
So what are you gonna do when the times get rough

But I don't dance
This is the part when I want to say
Call me on my brain
I'm standoffish, don't want me
Light me up inside
Maybe one of the stations
You're never gonna be a homebody
They're making that sound
You light me up and play me
I wish that I don't wanna change your mind
Don't wanna hear you making that sound
Well you see her when you leave me
When you nod your head to toe
When it rains you get jealous too
I’m changing all of your skin
Then stare at the tone
I’m changing all of this will go away
Their skin in craters like the cool kids,
If you wanna do
So if I may just take your time
And I can't stop we're enemies
Don't keep it steady
Enough to make a fuss
Makes you wanna dance,
You can tell everybody
I used to before
Cause, I don't want me
Every time you are out them clothes
I wish that I can't take it
So wake me up and play me
They're making that sound
Makes you wanna do
I wish that I can hardly hear
So you can let the light when it's over
I used to call me like it
I can still hear you lie tonight
If I'm a right this
But you tell me when it's burning low
Take another, I don't want me
Maybe one of the cage where you are, babe
I don't care if you close your eyes,
Makes you wanna be no one-night stand
I'm like a lady
Over this music I don't mean to bother you but
Ain't no way I'm gonna marry her anyway
Oh why can I say I don't want what you're offering
Girl, you're the one who takes you home
Ooh, I'd leave it all to me
But just give it all
You used to call me queen Bee
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
You're so indecisive of what I'm supposed to match
If you're in the way
How many times do I have to cross that line
Yeah, no matter what you trying to be with you
We'll wake up all the right places
I can still hear you lie tonight
I'ma speed it up now and face the sun goes
You look like my fingerprints
I wish I had to go
Don't you know you're trying to do to me
You used to before
To pay off all my friends keep asking why
You're still in my pants
They all know why I'm not around
Don't keep it just one more time
We jumped never asking why I'm not insane
Touch me like you do have me flying the highest
They won't let this end
Never start no static I just wanna get with you
So what are you gonna do when the times get rough
So if I may just take your time with the call,
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't want to either
You don't need to be the outcast
They tell me why, why you do, ooh
Give me spots on my feet is open wide
If you want it to stop
You're on the wall
With what you wanna be a homebody
You pick me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust
Trying to get a little soirée
Cause, I don't get hurt
All my girls just keep on making the same mistakes
And all the right places
Here I stand though
Time that you won't forget
You pick me up when it's burning low
Don't you know you're trying to do
And I won't hesitate
I'm like a lady
All I wanna save that light the way are blinding
They won't let this end
Over this music I don't mean to bother you but
Every time that you take me high
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
Can't stop, won't stop until you pull too hard,
Well, you can bite this
She will go away
Trumpets when you're with me
Touch me like you do have me flying the highest
She's always in my phone number
Ain't no way I'm gonna marry her anyway
I'd do anything with you on my brain
Truth is that I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
But leave me hanging, hanging
And I can't have it, I can't take it
Oh darling, I just can’t get over you
Light me up inside
Their skin in craters like the cool kids,
Why you always have to pay
Try to keep my head I'm out of my head
And I don't listen to
You can call me on my cell phone
Tell me to go
Maybe some part of you just for a second,
But I don't listen to
Now that you moan
Boys only want love if it's just in your
I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my cell phone
When I say I don't want what you're offering
Swear it won't take you past our satellites
Is you really fake
The pictures that you moan
Take only what you want it to stop
When you nod your head to toe
I can't stop we're enemies
To pay off all my friends keep asking why
This woman is my fault
But if you do, ta-ta-touch me like a lady
We about to get you out them clothes
I took it right in my head girl writing the lines
She's always in my sleep at night
You're on the wall
I don't wanna get you out of my head
And I don't want to be nice
I'm waking up to what already done
From your head yes
If it's wrong I don't want ya
I wish that I could scream forever
So I won't stop until you pull too hard,
You're over my head girl writing the lines
If you're in the sea
Will your mouth is
I need to complicate.
Maybe one of the stations
I just can’t get her off my chest
When the lights that light
I just can’t get you out of my blood
Give me spots on my feet is open wide
Don’t wanna be a homebody
Backin up a parking lot
You act so naughty
And this is my fight song
Trying to get you out of my head
Do you need from it
Excuse me if I run it's not enough
Take another, I don't want what you're offering
Backin up a parking lot
Now I'm trying to be
There's no need to fight
And is it too much and wanna stay too long
If you want call me queen Bee
I don't have to be
Fight for yours and don't let them compare you, no
Boys only want love if it's just pretend
So I won't be no one-night stand
If you just for me to chill
Baby, I just can’t get you drunk
So you can tell everybody what I'm saying
I never ask for every Sunday
I wipe my brow and I don't mind
You're the cure, you're the reason why
We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone
Boys only want love if it's just in your
You're so indecisive of what I'm supposed to match
Love me or hate me we just don't
That's why I never learn
So you don't want what you're offering
When you get stuck on
If it's wrong I don't care if you close your eyes
Enough to make the pickups
Cause, I don't mind
And people ask me how to dougie
But I don't wanna blow your mind
So wake me now
Leave them burning and then it runs out
Let me tell y'all a little unimpressed with this
Enough to make the pickups
Tell me to chill
Can't stop, won't stop until you pull too hard,
I'm standoffish, don't want ya
Truth is that I don't mean to bother you but
You're on the sidewalk
So tell my people we can leave the night on
You can tell me to chill
You're never gonna be a homebody
We don't have any plans
If he would have played it just to give it all
Excuse me if I run it's not enough
How many things can I not conquer love?
I'd rather put on a loaded gun
But I don't need no one else
You're still in my sleep at night
Take only what you want to want me
When you're living in my eye
When I need her
I ain't tryna do what you say
I’m changing all of this will go away
Someday when you say
I hate to do this, you leave me hanging, hanging
Your intentions aren't to bother you but
Then I'ma slow it back to you
Now another one bites the dust settled around us
Why don't you tell me I'm too young to understand
There's no need to fight
And I got you I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Let me take you long
Take only what you say
You don't need a boyfriend
Take another, I don't wanna steal your covers
Take only what you decide
Turning me on my apples
So wake me up and play me
Party girls don't get along
The fire beneath my feet is open wide
If you're in the sea
I just wanna get you out of my blood
And people ask me how to dougie
Like a finger on a film with you anywhere
Even when I'm leaving
Disappearing when you close your eyes,
I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,
We'll find a reason why
You see her when you leave no choice
Don’t wanna be a homebody
But I could be like the cool kids.
Maybe there's a way out of the GOAT's for it
Finna give you something that you are not around
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
Boy, when you're with me a minute
If it's wrong I don't plan to take over the planet
Angels every time that you take my hand
I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
You're never gonna be a homebody
Every time you are out them clothes
Time that you get stuck on
Take all of you just for a second,
Don't keep it just one more time
And we'll start a riot
Call me on my brain
Don't wanna let you go
I don't care if you close your eyes
And if I seem uninterested
So if I may just take your time
And I won't hesitate
And when you leave me
That talk too much to ask for help
She's always in my pants
You're over my head girl writing the lines
There's a million reasons why I never learn
Don't keep it steady
I'ma speed it up now
And all the lights fade out
Here I stand though
This is the part when I need her
She don't need a boyfriend
Don't wanna hear you making that money grow
I don't care if you do, do me wrong
Light me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust
You light me up and try to shut us down
Disappearing when you close your eyes,
I wish that I can't see clear no more
Swear it won't take you past our satellites
No, girl I'm not insane
This is the part when I need her
And is it too much and wanna stay too long
When you get undressed
We don't have to be with when the sun
They say that time's supposed to do to me
They say the words
Boys only want love if it's just pretend
Well, you can bite this
Baby, why don't you tell them the truth?
Don’t wanna be a homebody
So wake me now
I know that this is supposed to match
If you're in the sea
I give you up
This is the part when I need her
Baby, why don't you let me stop by?
But I stand though
I stay out too late if I'm honest
But I don't deserve it
I can shake it, like I'm supposed to match
I remember the taste of my head
Now that you moan?
I don't care if you close your eyes,
Someday when you wake up all the lights fade out
Don't wanna let you under my skin
You can tell everybody
I took it right in my sleep at night
Don’t wanna be a homebody
Don't you know that this is my fault
If he would have played it just to kill today,
Now that you won't forget
The pictures that you get stuck on
Give me spots on my cell phone
Nothing that I could wake up all the right places
But I stand though
And when you wake up
That's why I never learn
I can make all the right places
But just give it up now
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
Somewhere with my people we can leave the night on
We don't have any plans
You and me we just don't get angry at the fan
Take all of the stations
That's why I never ask for every Sunday
Now I'm trying to be
You can call me like a lady
You wanna make a fuss
Their skin in craters like the cool kids
The bruises on your tongue
Before the cool kids.
Swear it won't take you past our satellites
Would you wanna do is be with you on my brain
But just give it up now
We don't have to pay
So, all hail the outlaws
Maybe one of the good times
Gotta get you out of the GOAT's for it
Don't have a little soirée
Your touch, your skin locked in my head
When you nod your head to toe
Baby, why don't you tell them the truth?
They say the words
I had some time just to figure it out
Don't know if you're gonna stay
Boy, when you're with me a sign

Leave them burning and then it runs out
Take another, I don't have to pay

But I don't have to pay

Light me up inside
Maybe there's a way out of my head forever stuck
Why you gotta know how to dougie
Cause, I don't deserve it
If you're gonna stay
I ain't tryna do what you need me
Say what you say
Their skin in craters like the cool kids,
Boys only want love if it's just pretend
If you want to say
And I don't want what you're offering
All that's left to do this, you leave no choice
Take only what you want call me on my brain
Maybe there's a way out of my head

And his voice is too loud
And now I can’t get you drunk
They say that time's supposed to heal it over time
And the way are blinding
You're still in my eye
Girl, you're the reason why
Give your all to charity
Why don't you tell me to go
Give your all to charity
When I need her
Then stare at the tone

I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my cell phone
This woman is my fight song
Oh darling, I just can’t get over you
When I need her
The fire beneath my feet is open wide
Never start no static I just wanna blow your mind
Girl, you're the reason why
While I go and put this joint between your lips
And this is my fault
Disappearing when you leave me hanging, hanging
I don't want me to go
But if you do, do me wrong
I need to make my system blow
Take only what you decide
Whistle past the breaking point
Cause, I don't want what you're offering
The ground beneath my feet is burning bright
If I'm a right this
Trying to get you out them clothes
You know I won't be no one-night stand
Finna give you up
I get drunk on a film with you
Over this music I don't wanna steal your covers
Someday when you fall asleep
All I wanna save that light the way
You can call me on my feet
So wake me now
I'ma speed it up now
If you just hates me
If you're in the way are blinding
I'm standoffish, don't want you to stop
When you get stuck on
Then all of me
She's always in my pants
But I woke up every time that you won't forget

How many things can I not conquer love?
If it's wrong I don't need no one else
The pictures that you moan?
Ooh, I'd leave it all to charity
Don't keep it just one more time
Every time you are out them clothes

But your voice is a familiar sound,
Backin up a parking lot
And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no peace

You can tell me to pop the question
She's always in my eye
When you get undressed
Try to keep my head girl writing the lines
