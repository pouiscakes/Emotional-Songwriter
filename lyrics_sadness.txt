I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
Are you somewhere feeling lonely even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
I remember the day you told me you were leaving
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long
It's like we never happened, was it just a lie?
Like all of this was just some twisted dream
And you'd never slip away
They say we're too young now to amount to anything else
'Cause this deadbeat town's only here just to keep us down
While I was out, I found myself alone just thinking
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
But I ain't done much healing
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet
But when I call you never seem to be home
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
Anymore
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
(I guess right now you've got the last laugh)
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and
To some music with the message (like we usually do)
Not there in the kitchen with the girl
He can't take what's in his cup no more
I shoulda never come to this
Awfully sad it had to be that way
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here
Paid for every heart that I ever stole
Well it ain't that hard when you got soul (this is my world)
I been through the worst but I still give my best
Won't hide my tail or turn and run
I'll be the preacher you be the confession
I'll be the quick relief to all your stressin' (this is my world)
No surrender and I won't retreat (this is my world)
I had a dream so big and loud
I'm never gonna look back
No, just don't wake me now
I say we lose control (control)
Everything is looking up, everybody up now
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home
(hold up now)
I gotta be like oh, baby, no, baby, you got me all wrong, baby
I got somebody at home,
Now better men, than me have failed
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, baby, you got me all wrong, baby
I was a liar
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you
But I got nothing here without you
So one last time
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
I know I don't deserve it,
At least just temporarily
But I got nothing here without you, baby
I need to be the one who takes you home (la li he)
'Cause I don't wanna be without you
I need to be the one who takes you home (who takes you home, babe)
All I really care is you wake up in my arms (wake up in my arms)
I need to be the one who takes you home (yeah)
Well that's fine by me
All this time I was finding myself
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Wish that I could stay forever this young
I was left to my own dev-I-I-ces
Many days fell away with nothing to show
We were caught up and lost in all of our vices
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
Got me feeling like I can't be without ya
Ain't no words to describe you baby
Cause it just feels so right
She's ridin shot gun like it ain't no thing
Make ya wanna slide on in like, "Girl, what's up"
Girl she's got ya tappin on a boys shoulder
She'll have you on your knee, "Can I marry you?"
We fell in love
As the leaves turn brown
But you lied so soon
The beat goes on and on and on and on and
No silver or no gold
I'll fall right into you
Going under cast a spell just say the word
You are the light and I will follow
You let me lose my shadow
I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I wanna die in your arms
'Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
Buyin' drinks for everybody
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
In the baggage claim
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
The six ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
I should probably sign a Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
She said they love me unconditional
You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Ever since I left the city,
Everybody knows and I feel left out
'Cause ever since I left the city,
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
You don't need nobody else, no
You was in a zone, yeah
Ever since I left the city
And they all got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
Nothing in this world could ever bring them down.
Yeah, they're invincible, and she's just in the background.
And they said,
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
But then I jump right in
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend.
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10:00.
Baby, if you wanted me then you should've just said."
That heart is so cold
All over my home
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
But me and her we make money the same way
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
Or we'll be missing it now
How I was confused about
She was crying on my shoulder
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
It's not like we were both on tour
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize what you wanted
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
We made these memories for ourselves
Hearts are never broken
You won't ever be alone
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Hearts were never broken
And if you hurt me
That's OK, baby, only words bleed
Oh you can fit me
Keep it deep within your soul
I will remember how you kissed me
Ignoring everybody here
I want you to be mine, lady
Take another step into the no-man's land
I need you darling
If you feel you're falling
I saw flames from the side of the stage
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now, not
Can you feel it? All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it? Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand darling
And at most I'm sleeping all these demons away
But your ghost, the ghost of you
Each time that I think you're gone
True pain I don't deserve
Give up the ghost
No more haunting baby
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
Ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
Like gho-o-osts they want me to make 'em all
My, my, how the seasons go by
My ex's and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
We don't wanna leave, no. We just wanna be right now (right), r-r-right now
And it's over now, we got the love, there's no sleeping now, no sleeping now, no sleeping
We gonna let it burn burn burn burn (burn burn)
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
We'll go down in history
No, it's nothing wrong with me
Heavy metal broke my heart
The darkness that you felt
'Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
'Cause I, I am the opposite of amnesia
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon
We are the poisoned youth
"May nothing but death do us part..."
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
You bet your life on it
It may be hard for you to
She's the giggle at a funeral
I should've worshipped her sooner
She's the last true mouthpiece
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
Drain the whole sea
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Not a footprint to be seen
And it looks like I'm the queen.
Can't hold it back anymore
No right, no wrong, no rules for me I'm free!
You'll never see me cry!
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
I'm never going back,
That perfect girl is gone!
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
There's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
When you feel my heat
It's dark inside
It's the last of all
So they dug your grave
At the mess you made
It's a revolution, I suppose
All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Well, she looks back, yeah, she throws me a kiss, like "Honey, I sure want you."
You slip your finger through the tear in my t-shirt
Couldn't sing this song without you if I tried
Let's light it up like it's our last night
Laying right here naked in my bed
And light it up like it's our last chance
I wanna rock it all night
I wanna crawl through the dark
And they go
(Every time that you get undressed)
And the trumpets they go (Acapella on 'em)
(Derulo...)
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothin' I, no, I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do
Wearing nothing but a smile, fell to the floor
Just the thought of you gets me so high, so high
Just to get up next you (I would do anything)
Just to get up next you (anything and everything)
'Cause all of me
'Cause I give you all of me
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
But you wanna say no
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't want for us to end
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
First you wanna go to the left then you want to turn right
(Give it back back back)
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It's not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
Every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
And if you fall, you'll always land right in these arms
Don't act like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
You know that I'm the girl that you should call
So make a wish
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
And I'm so used to feeling numb
I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would have had a doubt
If I'd have known where I'd be now
I can't believe I ever breathed without you
'Cause this is where the car broke down
MTV on the RCA, no A/C in the vents
We were teenage dreamin', front seat leanin'
Uptown down home American kids
A little messed up, but we're all alright
Baptist church parkin' lot, tryin' not to get caught
Makin' it to second base, but sayin' you went all the way
Sister's got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
Uptown down home American Kids
A little messed up but we're all alright
Walk, come with me now
I think I've thought myself to death
Now only this seems clear
I need to lose myself tonight
I tried to sell my soul last night
Funny, he wouldn't even take a bite
8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home
Saying come on he ain't worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name
Now there's only one thing left for me to do
And kiss the past goodbye
Wanna get a little lost
Bring it till his memory fades away
I'll never settle down,
Yeah, I was that kind of man,
It Ain't my style, but I don't care
Love's never come my way,
But you took these two left feet
No, I don't dance, but here I am
It ain't my style, but I don't care
No...
I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
I wanna drown myself in a bottle of her perfume
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then you’d want me just as much
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush
I gotta girl crush
I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair.
My friends and I—we've cracked the code.
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
We aren't caught up in your love affair.
We've not yet lost all our graces
Even the comatose they don't dance and tell
We live in cities you'll never see on screen
So all the cups got broke shards beneath our feet but it wasn't my fault
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
Park it and we pile out
Just follow me down 'neath the 32 bridge
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend,
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
She was like, "Come here boy, I wanna dance."
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
But a little while later we were sittin' in the drive in my truck
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM, too
Man, you should have seen her light up
We were sittin' out under the stars
When I broke out my guitar
'Cause I know that you're an old-fashioned man, yeah
You say I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
Can't live without her
You say, I'll never get your blessing 'til the day I die
We would only hold on to let go
We need someone to lean on
All we need is somebody to lean on
Will you be there by my side?
Longing for you to come home
Just like animals, animals, like animals-mals
Maybe you think that you can hide
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
You can pretend that it was me
But no
But don't deny the animal
Don't tell no lie-lie-lie-lie
You can't deny-ny-ny-ny
No, girl, don't lie-lie-lie-lie
Just like animals (yeah...), animals (yeah...), like animals-mals (yeah...)
I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I like to think that we had it all
But on that road I took a fall
In your darkest nights
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I’m following the map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
'Cause every inch of you is perfect from the bottom to the top
She says, "Boys like a little more booty to hold at night"
(That booty, uh, that booty booty)
I'm bringing booty back
(That booty booty, uh, that booty booty)
You know I won't be no stick figure, silicone Barbie doll
My one and only all my life
So don't be thinking I'll be home and baking apple pies
If you wanna get that special lovin'
And maybe then I'll let you try and rock my body right (right)
Even if I was wrong
[Laugh] You know I'm never wrong
Don't leave me lonely
And know we'll never see your family more than mine
Anybody could be that guy
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
Looking out for another, anyone will do
I can't pretend anymore
Never by the hands of a broken heart
You were better, deeper
I was under your spell
She goes with me to a blossom world
Ain't got no place to lay your head
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
(Put a smile on your face, don't bring everybody down)
I don't wanna become someone
I was crying on the bathroom floor
And just when I thought I could take no more
She went whistling through the graveyard
And I was a stain on her unmade bed
I found a lover and then I lost myself
And everybody loves a comeback
Why was I the last to know?
Hear the words, I've never been laid so low
Don't let me be the last to know
I just wanna lay in my bed
I said it 'cause I can
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I threw a wish in the well,
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell,
I'd trade my soul for a wish,
Your stare was holdin',
It's hard to look right
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all,
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
I missed you so, so bad (bad, bad)
Come on little miss and do the twist
Come on miss and do the twist
Can't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel
That is what my youth was for
Left you with nothing but they want some more
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
They're breaking your heart
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
But I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
Our name is our virtue.
The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping 
I dreamt I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They took all the trees
That you don't know what you've got 'til its gone?
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
Doh doh doh, doh duh (Aaaaaaow!)
That ice cold
Gotta kiss myself I'm so pretty
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Make a dragon wanna retire, man
'Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to ya
Don't believe me just watch (Come on)
Doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh (Hah!)
Don't believe me just watch
Don't believe me just watch (come on)
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, uh
I said Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up
Crawling on your knees toward it
We like to watch you laughing
No time to think of consequences
Crying out for attention
Memories fade
Like looking through a fogged mirror
Everybody wants me to be who they want me to be except you
I don’t wanna be with nobody new
Gets complicated, I feel devastated
But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be with you
But there’s one thing I remember, I only wanna be with you
(Break it down right here now)
Like John and Yoko
Come be my fiance
That I only wanna be your man
They say there may be rain but the sun is hot.
And I wish I had a dime for every bill I had to pay.
Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as the times your in.
So I jump back into where I learn to swim.
I saw my friend Bobby he said, "What's up man?
He said I'm glad to see, they can take away my job but not my friends you see.
(Here we go)
I want to go where the sun will never end
The stereo bumpin' till the sun goes down, and I only want to hear that sound
You're the one I want to be with, when the sun goes down.
You're the one I want to be with, when the sun goes down
You're the one I want to be with when the sun goes down.
By now you should've somehow
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
Like to say to you
But they'll never throw it back to you
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
When I lost it,
But I tossed it,
That we crushed it,
But it's in the past.
With a broken toy,
All lost and coy,
As a broken man,
Now I'm falling down,
And you rushed to me,
So I fall to my knees,
I fall on the floor and I'm laughing.
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot
(That's) why I don't cry when my dog runs away
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane
I was young so I forgot
Follow the signs right back to you
Back to you, back to you
Even the dead deserve a song
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
I'm thinking out loud
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mmm...)
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
Thinking out loud
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me to the dark
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)
Everybody hating, we just call them fans though
I hit the strip with my trap queen 'cause all we know is bands
She ain't wanting for nothin' because I got her everything
It's big ZooWap from the bando, remind me where I can't go
Everybody hating, we just call them fans, though
'Cause Remy Boyz or nothing, Re-Re-Remy Boyz or nothing
Money outta sight cause fights
I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down
When I'm without you
You got me begging, begging
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
'Cause I really don't care where you are
Won't you come and put it down on me?
When I'm without ya
I'm so insecure
I want that sugar sweet
Unless that somebody's me
'Cause girl you're hotter than a southern California day
I don't wanna play no games
No make-up on
Won't you come and put it down on me (down on me)?
I'm right here (right here), 'cause I need ('cause I need)
Won't you come and put it down on me? (down on me, down on me)
Me a di a di girl in the tight up skirt
All these other girls are tempting but I'm empty when you're gone
Do I make you feel like cheating
I'm like no not really (nuh uh)
Cause oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
Walk like a model, talk like a model
Been looking like say I won the lotto
You're the only girl for me
No I don't need no next one
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
If the high was worth the pain
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
But you'll come back each time you leave
"Oh don't you dare look back.
We were victims of the night,
"Oh, don't you dare look back.
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks,
"Don't you dare look back.
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm so used to being used
You know our love would be tragic, oh, yeah
We live with no lies
On that lonely night
We said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush
It made us believe it was only us, only us
When you say you love me
Know I need you more
When I'm crying out for you
You and me - we're meant to be
When he led me to you
We kissed, I fell under your spell.
A love no one could deny
Don't you ever say I just walked away
I can't live a lie, running for my life
I never hit so hard in love
All I wanted was to break your walls
All you ever did was wreck me
Yeah, you, you wreck me
I put you high up in the sky
It slowly turned, you let me burn
Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
Left me crashing in a blazing fall
I never meant to start a war
I just wanted you to let me in
I guess I should've let you win
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never going out of style
The way you save me
I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Thinking I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Anything for you to notice
I could walk you down the aisle
Everything is so throwback-ish (I kinda like it, like it)
You're one of a kind living in a world gone plastic
I'm slowly drifting away (drifting away)
I'm slowly drifting (drifting away)
And it feels like I'm drowning
I wish I could make it easy
But still I reach
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh
No shirt, no blouse
'Cause it's too cold
So move to a place so far away
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
It's too cold
It's too cold,
The holes of my sweater...
My Anaconda don't want none unless you got buns hun
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Now that's real, real, real,
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like...
This dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
I let him hit it 'cause he slang Cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
So I pulled up in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like...
Little in the middle but she got much back
(Don't don't don't) Don't want none unless you got buns hun
With her wine-stained lips, yeah, she nothing but trouble
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
Tryna break the chains but the chains only break me
Oh no, wasted again but I can't say no, no
Gave you my heart but you took my soul
But I wouldn't change (I wouldn't change)
But I wouldn't change (wouldn't change)
But I wouldn't change, ooh
I don't like the way he's looking at you
Am I crazy? Have I lost ya?
Even though I know you love me, can't help it
I mean no disrespect
I still get jealous
And everybody wants a taste
That's why (that's why)
I wish you didn't have to post it out
I wish you'd save a little bit just for me
And everybody wants to taste
You're the only one invited
I said there's no one else for you
If one thing I know, I'll fall but I'll grow
That's just how I feel
Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how we feel
Am I wrong (am I wrong)
Now am I wrong (am I wrong)
But that's just how I feel,
So am I wrong (am I wrong)
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah
You stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left (nothing left)
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun (see the sun)
You taught me how to be someone
Nobody can drag me
Having no regrets is all that she really wants
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost
It will never change, baby
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The way that I been holding on too tight
The story of my life
I take her home
Until she's broke
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed, still
The way that I been holding on so tight
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds
Until she's broke (until she's broke inside)
Lately I've been, I've been losing sleep
And I don't think the world is sold
And I I I I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?
Oh, take that money watch it burn,
Take that money watch it burn,
I'll be doin' this, if you had a doubt,
I'll be your ghost, your game, your stadium.
I'm killing every second 'til it saves my soul.
There's a maniac out in front of me.
And I'm saying them, 'cause I'm so devout.
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
Ain't it good being all alone
So what are you gonna do when nobody wants to fool with you?
Ain't it good to be on your own
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one
Don't go crying to your mama 'cause you're on your own in the real world
Ain't it good, ain't it good being all alone
('Cause the world don't orbit around you)
Ain't it good, ain't it good being all alone (oh)
(Don't go crying to your mama)
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
But never to touch and never to keep
Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep
Take back my life song
And I don't really care if nobody else believes
'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me
Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep
Say I'm in too deep (in too deep)
I miss my home
No I've still got a lot of fight left in me
All I need's a little love in the dark
Me and my broken heart
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
Tear me apart and then some
It seems like we've been losing control
Somebody tell me I'm not alone
Me and my broken
(Me and my broken, broken heart)
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
We'll go to town like they're in your living room
Let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
All up after the sun goes down
But layin' down would be in vain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
I couldn't just walk by
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
I don't know you but I want to
I don't have to make you love me
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
'Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
But I know that I still need you here
I know I'm not the only one
Now sadly I know why
By lying and tearing us up
Where I was right there
The days just seem so dark
Are nothing without you
The way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness
This hole that I'm inside
These tears
Told me not to cry when you were gone
Can I lay by your side?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy
You told me not to cry when you were gone
Lay me down tonight
Lay me by your side
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt
Or be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that words do
Kept on the inside and no sunlight
And let the words fall out
I just wanna see you
Everybody's been there,
Everybody's been stared down by the enemy
Bow down to the mighty
Let your words be anything but empty
You might be right but I don't care
Heroin drip, no more so
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breaking me down, down, down, down
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
And now that I'm without your kisses
Tripping over myself
Aching, begging you to come help
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Tripping over myself,
Shaking, falling onto my knees (falling on my knees)
Aching, begging you to come help (begging, "Baby, please.")
I'm without your kisses
I push it down, push it down
Throw 'em back, till I lose count
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry
But I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes
Sun is up, I'm a mess
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame
Throw 'em back till I lose count
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one
You did not break me
But you won't see me fall apart
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
It's hard to lose a chosen one
(You did not break me, no)
You know it used to be mad love
Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I
So don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey)
You know it used to be mad love (mad love)
And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them)
I never miss a beat
I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (and fake, and fake, and fake)
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Could end in burning flames or paradise
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style
We never go out of style.
Take me home
Just take me home, yeah.
Just take me home
(out of style)
I thought heaven can't help me now.
And when we've had our very last kiss
You see me in hindsight
I bet these memories
Even if it's just in your (just pretend, just pretend)
Cause you dry my tears
And it's all because
You been through the worst let me show you who the best
You the one who's hella bad, yeah
You the one they never had, yeah, oh, yeah
[Clean version:] Leave them broke fellas in the past, yeah, oh, yeah
I'll have you thinking 'bout forever
(Everybody say)
Now whip it straight back to the crib
I just wanna see you dance in...
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
And she's been living on the highest shelf
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
Oh Lady, running down to the riptide
Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Lost souls in revelry
