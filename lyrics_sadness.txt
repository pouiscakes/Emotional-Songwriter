And they all went into the ark, for to get out of the rain.
The animals went in three by three, the wasp, the ant and the bumble bee
The animals went in four by four, the great hippopotamus stuck in the door
The animals went in six by six, they turned out the monkey because of his tricks
And they all went into the ark, for to get out of the rain. 
The animals went in nine by nine, marching up in a long straight line,
The animals went in ten by ten, the last one was a little red hen,
Put your hands down on your knees. 
Put your hands down on your knees.  
Over the hill and far away
But only four little ducks came back.
But only three little ducks came back.
But only two little ducks came back.
But only one little duck came back.
But none of the five little ducks came back.
Sad mother duck
The sad mother duck said
Knees and toes.
When you need someone to help,
Sleep pretty baby, do not cry
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
That's the way the money goes
Mama's going to buy you a cart and bull.
Mama's going to buy you a horse and cart.
So hush little baby, don't you cry,
Don't you remember Cotton-eyed Joe? 
If it hadn't been for Cotton-eyed Joe! 
Hi's teeth was out n' his nose was flat, 
His eyes was crossed, 
Kase he was tall, and berry slim, 
Her lips was red n' her eyes was bright, 
Her skin was black but her teeth was white. 
N' swore fum ne she'd never move, 
But Joe hoodooed her, don't you see, 
No, no, no, I don't want to wear my shoes
No, no, no, hold on, I'll try it now!
No, no, no, watch out, I'll try it now!
No, no, no, get on, I'll push you now
Hark don't you, 
There was a snail called Herbert who was so very slow
When Herbert was much younger, he often got in trouble
As you can well imagine, there's a moral to this tale
We all fall down 
We all fall down  
We all fall down
Brush away that black cloud from your shoulder.
Twitch your whiskers. Feel that you're really real.
You wish you were a man
Am I just the company you keep
Fly away home.
And your children all gone.
All except one,
Four little pumpkins crying, crying.
Four little pumpkins are sad.
Five little pumpkins laughing, laughing.
You never know, dear, how much I love you
The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamt I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head, and I cried
With a knick knack paddy wack
With a knick knack paddy wack 
The ants go marching three by three,
And they all go marching down to the ground
The ants go marching nine by nine,
Now there are no green speckled frogs!
If you chanced to visit,
And the dear boy in blue
Then drop in to have tea
Was still out around noon,
With a quick wave 'Goodbye.'
Tip me over and pour me out
Who lives on down the lane
The bear went over the mountain,
The other side of the mountain,
This little piggy went to market.
This little piggy had roast beef.
But this little piggy had none.
This little piggy kicked the football
This little piggy fell asleep
This little piggy went
London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down
London Bridge is falling down my fair lady.
London Bridge is falling down my fair lady 
Little Miss Muffet
Who sat down beside her
And frightened Miss Muffet away.
He stuck a feather in his hat,
Miss Polly had a dolly
He looked at the dolly
And he said "Miss Polly,
Put her straight to bed."
Away we go, away we go
As I was walking down the street,
They lost their mittens,
And they began to cry,
Our mittens we have lost.
What! Lost your mittens,
Then you shall have no pie.
Mee-ow, mee-ow,
You shall have no pie.
Our mittens we have soiled.
Then they began to sigh,
They began to sigh.
Oh mother dear,
Baa baa black sheep
That lives down the lane
And everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go
Which was against the rule
Now let's wave goodbye. Goodbye!
I like to oot, oot, oot, oo-pples and ba-noo-noos.
