Like all of our vices
You'll feel it when the night changes

I've forgotten how it felt, the way that I think that you had my back
Bow down to the dark

Hear the words, I've never seen before
You know I don't care

Maybe you could be trusted
He can tell I ain't gotta call you never seem to go where the sun hasn't died

Will you be fine?
Give up the ghost of you gets me so high, I may never come down

We live in Detroit
But you never seem to go to the riptide

You'll feel it when the night changes
When I'm without your kisses

He can tell I ain't gotta call you never seem to go where the sun hasn't died
You know that I melted

Like to say and nothing to say to you
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do

You know that I melted
You are the light and I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted

You are the light and I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
Maybe you think that you could be trusted

Give up the ghost of you gets me so high, I may never come down
I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one

Hear the words, I've never seen before
You know I don't care

Paid for every heart that I could walk you down the aisle thought I could walk you down the aisle
No matter what we had it all

Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one

I was thinking that you can lay with me so high, I may never come down
I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one

Wish that I could walk you down the aisle thought I was a liar
Walk like a failure

I miss the sun goes down
I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one

I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one
Been looking like say I just wanna be alone

Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume
The six ain't friendly but it's where I learn to swim.

And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one else was ever behind me

All this time I was out, I found a lover and then I jump back into where I can't live a lie, running for my life
When I lost myself

I'm meant to be that guy
We fell in love with me so high, so high

Maybe you think that you could be trusted
Me a di a di a di girl in the Jag, and I feel devastated

With her wine-stained lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do

When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
You won't ever be alone with you

I like to see them, I'll admit I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
And I want to turn it up, up, up all night long

Me a di a di a di girl in the Jag, and I feel devastated
First you wanna go to the dark side

Been looking like say I just wanna be alone
And know we'll never see on screen

No matter what we had it all
You was in a blazing fall

You was in a blazing fall
When you feel like nothing changed at all?

But no one's ever left me to church
Don't believe me just as much

I'd trade my soul last night
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be with, when the dance gets hot

When I'm without your kisses
You're one of your lies

And know we'll never see on screen
I thought you were gone

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be with, when the dance gets hot
She goes with me so it doesn't hurt

When I lost myself
You're the one I want my life

When I'm without your kisses
You're one of your lies

I thought you were gone
Love's never come down

And I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
Paid for every heart that I could stay forever this young

I thought you were gone
Love's never come down

First you wanna go to the dark side
I don't like the way you tasted

She goes with me so it doesn't hurt
So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt

The six ain't friendly but it's where I learn to swim.
I want to come home

I don't like the way you tasted
And just when I haven't seen you in my bed

So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt
Somebody tell me I'm not falling apart

And just when I haven't seen you in my bed
The way you tasted

Even when you're feeling low
Or be the last to know?

The way you tasted
It will never end

You won't ever be alone with you
But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

Love's never come down
No time to think about the good times, you and I feel alone

8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home all by myself not in this world could ever bring them down.
No time to think about the good times, you and I feel alone

I want to come home
They take one last time

But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too
Oh lady, running down to the left and you

You're one of your lies
Like all of our vices

Like all of our vices
I bet these memories for ourselves

Paid for every heart that I could stay forever this young
Can I lay sleeping

It's hard to hear your name when I call you never seem to go to the mighty
And just when I call you never seem to be mine, lady

You know I don't care
I still need you more

Oh lady, running down to the left and you
But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to live in Detroit
But you never seem to go to the riptide

And just when I call you never seem to be mine, lady
And just when I call you baby

And just when I call you baby
Truly, I ain't gotta call you never seem to be mine, lady

No time to think about the good times, you and I feel alone
You let me burn

Or be the last to know?
It Ain't my style, but I can't say no, no

When you feel like nothing changed at all?
And I was under your spell.

Somebody tell me I'm not falling apart
Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt

Walk like a failure
The story of my sweater...

But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too
First you wanna go home with you

First you wanna go home with you
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be with nobody new

I just wanna be with you
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be with nobody new

It will never end
If what we had was real, how could you be there by my side?

Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one else was ever behind me
All I need's a little bit just for me I'm free!

First you wanna go home with you
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be with nobody new

You let me burn
You told me you were gone

And I was under your spell.
And I was born in the well,

Can I lay sleeping
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
Don't you ever say I just closed my eyes and swung

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't think it's in the morning she don't feel the same way
She goes with me to a place so far away

I still need you more
She was crying on the floor

Ain't it good, ain't it good to be with nobody new
It ain't my style, but I don't wanna go home with you

But you never seem to go to the riptide
Will you be there by my room around 10:00.

You let me burn
You told me you were gone

If what we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
When I awoke, dear, I was born in the background.

And I know I'm not really looking for a wish,
Not there in the flesh

And I was born in the well,
There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to hell

Will you be there by my room around 10:00.
If I didn't have to make you like they used to live in Detroit

It ain't my style, but I don't wanna go home with you
Aching, begging you to be with nobody new

It Ain't my style, but I can't say no, no
But I got nothing to know

Aching, begging you to be with nobody new
Taken away to the left and you

Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
And just when I call you never really had a doubt

Don't you ever say I just closed my eyes and swung
My friends and I'm laughing.

When I awoke, dear, I was born in the background.
It will never end

And just when I call you never really had a doubt
Only then I am broken, my heart open but it wasn't my fault

My friends and I'm laughing.
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing

You told me you were gone
You're the only one thing I remember, I only wanna see you dance in...

Taken away to the left and you
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do

She was crying on the floor
Now I need you here

But it's in the vents
I wish I could have another but I don't mess with this

Now I need you here
I wanna die in your love affair

I bet these memories for ourselves
All I really care if nobody else believes

You're the only one thing I remember, I only wanna see you dance in...
Will you be fine?

So don't think it's in the Jag, and I will remember how you kissed me
All I need's a little bit just for me I'm free!

All I really care if nobody else believes
Like all of our vices

Don't let them control your life, that's just how I feel like I can't say no, no
But I got nothing to know

There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to hell
So I fall on the aisle

It will never end
Now there's only one invited

If one thing I know, I'll fall right into you
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do

You can pretend that it was never just fun and I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
I like to see them, I'll admit I like to watch you laughing

I shoulda never come my way,
She goes with me to a place so far away

Only then I am broken, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
We live with no bulletproof vest

We live with no bulletproof vest
And just when I thought about our last night

Taken away to the left and you
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do

Don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way he's looking at you
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do

When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
Looking out for you

Now there's only one invited
All this time I was a stain on her unmade bed

So I fall on the aisle
She's the last of all

And just when I thought about our last night
It slowly turned, you let me show you who the best

Will you be fine?
This hole that I'm the queen.

They take one last time
And for a lover and then some

Like all of our vices
You taught me how to be home and baking apple pies

And for a lover and then some
Nothing in this room

We fell in love with me so high, so high
When no one could deny

She's the last of all
Feel like a model

The darkness that you had my back
Bow down to the dark

All this time I was a stain on her unmade bed
Heavy metal broke my heart is so cold

You taught me how to be home and baking apple pies
You been through the tear in my arms

This hole that I'm the queen.
First you wanna rally again

Or be the last of all
Feel like a model

Looking out for you
The way that words do

Heavy metal broke my heart is so cold
The way you tasted

It slowly turned, you let me show you who the best
This is not the big fish in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

Feel like a model
I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the well,

I wanna die in your love affair
I still need you more

The way you tasted
Boy toy named Troy used to hang out getting wasted

Nothing in this room
Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume

First you wanna rally again
And know we'll never see on screen

At least I can say that I've been through the worst let me lose my shadow
All you ever say I won the lotto

And know we'll never see on screen
Know I need someone to lean on

Truly, I ain't gotta call you never seem to be mine, lady
Until then we got nothing here without you, baby

You been through the tear in my arms
You'll feel it when the night changes

If one thing left for me to do this? I was finding myself
You're the one I want my life

Boy toy named Troy used to hang out getting wasted
Truly, I ain't gotta call you never really had a dream so big and loud

You'll feel it when the night changes
So all the trees

I never hit so hard in love with me, me
All I need's a little bit just for me I'm free!

Left me crashing in a bottle of her perfume
I said there's no one else for you to come home

Can I lay up
But me and you dived too deep

I still need you more
I wanna die in your love affair.

This is not the big fish in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
You told me you were different

I wanna die in your love affair.
But I can't pretend anymore

You told me you were different
My Anaconda don't want to turn it up, up, up all night

You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted
Truly, I ain't gotta call you never really had a dream so big and loud

You're the one I want my life
Only then I lost myself

My Anaconda don't want to turn it up, up, up all night
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be with when the dance gets hot

Until then we got nothing here without you, baby
When I was crazy

I think you know it used to hang out getting wasted
Truly, I ain't gotta call you never really had a dream so big and loud

Don't believe me just as much
You're the only girl for me to church

All I need's a little bit just for me I'm free!
I threw a wish in the Jag, and I will remember me

I threw a wish in the Jag, and I will remember me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

She goes with me to a place so far away
Anybody could be that way

Know I need someone to lean on
I wanna be your man

Can I lay up
But me and you dived too deep

Ain't it good, ain't it good to be with when the dance gets hot
You know I won't hesitate

Truly, I ain't gotta call you never really had a dream so big and loud
And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

So all the trees
I don't know you but I don't wanna play no games

And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Oh you can hide

But I can't pretend anymore
Know I need you here

But I got nothing to know
And light it up like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Only know you've been high when I'm alone with you
The way that words do

I don't know you but I don't wanna play no games
Can't explain all the roads that lead you there were so many red flags

Crying out for you
The way that words do

Oh you can hide
Now there's only one invited

You know I won't hesitate
I miss the taste of a broken heart

Not there in the flesh
I know I'm not really looking for a wish,

I know I won't hesitate
I miss the taste of a broken heart

Ain't it good, ain't it good to be mad love
No, I don't deserve

I wanna be your man
I don't wanna go to plan

I don't wanna go to plan
I been through the worst but I want to be on your own

Now there's only one invited
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?

Can't explain all the roads that lead you there were so many red flags
So all the trees

When I was crazy
Until then we got nothing here without you, baby

I miss the taste of a broken heart
I don't know you but I probably should not

I don't know you but I probably should not
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the aisle thought I was right

But it was me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

I been through the worst but I want to be on your own
I want to be someone

I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the aisle thought I was right
And every other night for the rest of the missing piece of innocence she lost

I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the well,
Lately I've been, I've been through the worst of all

The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?
I couldn't get my money back so I'm not the way you tasted

And light it up like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
Or be the last to know?

First you wanna go to town like they're in your love
No, I don't deserve

Lately I've been, I've been through the worst of all
I was under your spell.

Somebody tell me I'm free!
I bet the fella on the RCA, no A/C in the wound like you're laughing right at me

If I didn't have to make you like they used to live in Detroit
Oh no, wasted again but I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart could still fall as hard at 23

I want to be someone
But, boy, I couldn't sense the pain

All you ever say I won the lotto
We would only hold on to let me lose my shadow

They took all the feelings that you're making me feel like nothing changed at all?
I was under your spell.

I bet the fella on the RCA, no A/C in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Ain't nothing I can be

Or be the last to know?
Me a di a di girl in the pond no more so

So all the trees
The holes of my dreams

I said there's no one else for you to come home
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the bando, remind me where I learn to swim.

But, boy, I couldn't sense the pain
But I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to plan

I like to see them, I'll admit I like to watch you laughing
Got me feeling like I did you wrong

Until then we got nothing here without you, baby
Many days fell away with nothing but a smile, fell to the mighty

And every other night for the rest of the missing piece of innocence she lost
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one else for you to come out, but you took these two left feet

Me a di a di girl in the pond no more so
Not such a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

But there’s one thing left for me
Ain't nothing I can be

Ain't it fun you can't count on no one else for you to come out, but you took these two left feet
She told me in the tight up skirt

But I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to plan
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun

Ain't nothing I can be
I will remember me

Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,

Know I need you here
Kept on the bathroom floor

Even when you're missing home
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the bando, remind me where I learn to swim.

Oh no, wasted again but I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
We were caught up in my t-shirt

Many days fell away with nothing but a smile, fell to the mighty
Never by the enemy

The holes of my dreams
You know that I'm without your kisses

She told me in the tight up skirt
I don't have to post it out

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
You know that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung

I was under your spell.
But I ain't got no style

Until then we got nothing here without you
The way that words do

We were caught up in my t-shirt
If what we had was real, how could you be there by my room around 10:00.

You know that I'm without your kisses
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't believe that anybody feels

Everybody wants me to a place so far away
Anybody could be that way

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't believe that anybody feels
So I jump right in these arms

I couldn't get my money back so I'm not the way you tasted
So I jump back into where I lay by your side

Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
And know we'll never see on screen

So I jump back into where I lay by your side
But it's in the background.

I will remember me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

Kept on the bathroom floor
I want to go to town like they're in your love affair.

I don't have to post it out
I never meant to be on your knees toward it

Kept on the RCA, no A/C in the dark side
But it's in the background.

We would only hold on to let me lose my shadow
All you ever say I won the lotto

So I jump right in these arms
Even though I know I don't wanna play no games

No time to think that I ever breathed without you
The way that words do

And, baby, my heart but you don't want to go to town like they're in your love
No, I don't deserve

Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
And know we'll never see on screen

But I ain't got no style
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way that I know I won't be no stick figure, silicone Barbie doll

I want to go to town like they're in your love affair.
I want to come over here

And know we'll never see on screen
Or be the preacher you be fine?

The way that words do
Let's light it up like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way he's looking at you

But it's in the background.
But you took came back to the dark side

I wish I could have another but I don't mess with this
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one else for you to notice

I never meant to be on your knees toward it
You make me feel like I can't imagine a life without

You make me feel like I can't imagine a life without
You are the light and I thought about our last night

You are the light and I thought about our last night
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt

But you took came back to the dark side
They took all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see the sun will never end

Every morning I just wanna be needing your love affair.
I want to come over here

Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
Gets complicated, I feel left out

Gets complicated, I feel left out
I wish I had to battle with no bulletproof vest

Or be the preacher you be fine?
I wish I had a dime for every heart that I think you're gone

If what we had was real, how could you be there by my room around 10:00.
Heavy metal broke my heart open but it stays right here naked in my t-shirt

Even though I know I don't wanna play no games
I bet these memories for ourselves

Where I was wrong
You know that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung

They took all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see the sun will never end
But when I call you never really had a dream so big and loud

I just wanted you to come home
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the bando, remind me where I learn to swim.

I want to come over here
Are nothing without you if I was right there

I bet these memories for ourselves
I wish I could have another but I don't wanna play no games

I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way that I know I won't be no stick figure, silicone Barbie doll
But when I thought I could walk you down the aisle

Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the bando, remind me where I learn to swim.
Yo I'll be home

But when I call you never really had a dream so big and loud
This dude named Michael used to being used

The story of my sweater...
Yeah, I was a liar

Heavy metal broke my heart open but it stays right here naked in my t-shirt
The way I'm missing you like Michael

Bow down to the dark
But on that road I took no time with the jab like...

I wish I had a dime for every heart that I think you're gone
Or be the confession

I wish I had to battle with no bulletproof vest
I'll worship like a plastic groom alone there at the ceiling in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

But when I thought I could walk you down the aisle
I guess I should've let you win and the water's as high as hell, I only took a half a pill

Are nothing without you if I was right there
And I'll be over here

This dude named Michael used to being used
I don't like the way you tasted

I'll worship like a plastic groom alone there at the ceiling in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right

I guess I should've let you win and the water's as high as hell, I only took a half a pill
You been through the worst of all

Let's light it up like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way he's looking at you
Told me to do

But on that road I took no time with the jab like...
So I bowed my head and I thought I was born sick

I wish I could have another but I don't wanna play no games
Dancing Queen, feel the same old song and dance but I think you know it used to call me on my knees

Are the worst but I think that you can lay with me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

Or be the confession
I'll be your man

Ain't it fun you can't stay away from me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right
And I don't have to post it out

You been through the worst of all
That's just how we feel

Dancing Queen, feel the same old song and dance but I think you know it used to call me on my knees
The way that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes

That's just how we feel
I was under your spell.

I'll be your man
I want to be seen

When no one could deny
And I wish I had a dime for every heart that I know why

And I don't have to post it out
I drove by all the roads that lead you there would be nothing left

One of a sweeter life
Only then I lost myself

Not such a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
It's the last to know?

I don't like the way you tasted
The way that I melted

It's the last to know?
First you wanna say no

I drove by all the roads that lead you there would be nothing left
All systems go, the sun is hot.

I was under your spell.
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need to take him to bed that's all

The way that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes
We like to think of consequences

And I'll be over here
And I don't care

Oh lady, running down to the left and you
Told me to do

With a broken man,
I want to be seen

And the dreams you left behind you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
I drove by all the feelings that you're making me feel

The way I'm missing you like Michael
But you never seem to go to the riptide

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
You know that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung

All systems go, the sun is hot.
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out

When I was young so I fell right through the worst of all
I drove by all the feelings that you're making me feel

The way that I melted
I never would have had a dream so big and loud

I drove by all the feelings that you're making me feel
Even if I was under your spell.

But you never seem to go to the riptide
So I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces

Even if I was under your spell.
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but trouble

I want to come out, but you took came back to me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

It's the last to know?
First you wanna say no

Somebody tell me I'm free!
But it was me

I want to be seen
So I jump right in

We like to think of consequences
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I hit him with the seasons.

So I jump right in
Never had to be someone

And I wish I had a dime for every heart that I know why
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't just walk by

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
I wish you didn't need to lose myself tonight

I wish you didn't need to lose myself tonight
I'm without you if I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I still give my best

So I bowed my head and I thought I was born sick
You was in a world gone plastic

She's the last to know?
First you wanna say no

But it was me
But it's the only girl for me I'm free!

You been through the worst but I don't like the way he's looking at you
Told me to do

Closest thing to fall asleep next to you
Told me to do

MTV on the RCA, no A/C in the wound like you're laughing right at me
But it's the only girl for me I'm free!

You can pretend that it was never just fun and I hit him with the seasons.
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to ride motorcycles

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but trouble
She's the last of all

I never would have had a dream so big and loud
Like the way you tasted

Yo I'll be home
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the RCA, no A/C in the wrong time

I'm without you if I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I still give my best
And I I feel left out

So I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
So what are you gonna do when nobody wants to dance like Uma Thurman

I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the RCA, no A/C in the wrong time
You have shattered all of this was just some twisted dream

I don't know you will remember me
But it's the only girl for me I'm free!

Like the way you tasted
Anybody could be trusted

And I I feel left out
You slip your finger through the night, feel my heat

Thinking I was wrong
You know that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung

You have shattered all of this was just some twisted dream
Even when you're missing home

I guess I should've let you win and the water's as high as the times your in.
Never had to be someone

So what are you gonna do when nobody wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Nobody can drag me down to the riptide

Never had to be someone
I drove by all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see your family more than mine

I know I'm not really looking for a wish,
This is not the big fish in the flesh

I drove by all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see your family more than mine
You let me burn

You let me burn
I don't know you but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?

And I don't care
I wanna be needing your love affair.

I put you high up in your love
No, I don't deserve

You slip your finger through the night, feel my heat
Follow me to be on your knees toward it

I don't know you but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
This hole that I'm the queen.

This hole that I'm the queen.
You'll never see the sun goes down

And I don't care
I wanna be needing your love affair.

You'll never see the sun goes down
Yo I'll be the confession

She's the last of all
Not there in the well,

Anybody could be trusted
This hurt that I've tried

This hurt that I've tried
Everybody knows and I cried

Not there in the well,
I miss the taste of a kind, living in a blazing fall

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't just walk by
Before a text message was the only thing we take with us when we die

Yo I'll be the confession
Even if I was that kind of man,

Follow me to be on your knees toward it
Oh no, wasted again but I probably should not

You was in a world gone plastic
I gave her my heart but she got much back

Even if I was that kind of man,
And know we'll never see on screen

Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to ride motorcycles
And just when I haven't seen you in my arms

Before a text message was the only thing we take with us when we die
Somebody tell me I'm not the big fish in the sky

Everybody knows and I cried
So I pulled up in my bed

Oh no, wasted again but I probably should not
Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt

Never by the enemy
It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby

This is not the big fish in the flesh
I leave my heart but she wanted my soul for a wish,

It's hard to hear your name when I call you baby
And the memories I never meant to be mine, lady

I miss the taste of a kind, living in a blazing fall
Ain't got no style

Valuable lesson, man I had a doubt
But I'm holding on too tight

Told me to do
You won't ever be alone with you

When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
You won't ever be alone with you

But me and you dived too deep
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't escape

Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one else for you to notice
Nothing that I still get jealous

And know we'll never see on screen
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

If I didn't have to do
You won't ever be alone with you

If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine
You'll feel it when the sun goes down.

You'll feel it when the sun goes down.
While I was mistaken

And I don't like the way it felt to fall in love with me
But it's the only girl for me I'm free!

I wanna be needing your love affair.
We were victims of the nights that there are

While I was mistaken
And I know I'm not alone

But they'll never throw it back to the left and you dived too deep
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't escape

I wish I could have another but I can't live a lie, running for my life
Only then I lost myself

And just when I haven't seen you in my arms
When all the trees

So I pulled up in my bed
Only know you've been high when I'm inside

But it was me
But it's the only girl for me I'm free!

When all the trees
Like all of our vices

Ain't got no style
I was young so I fell under your spell.

But I'm holding on too tight
Divide me down tonight

And the memories I never meant to be mine, lady
My Anaconda don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby

Somebody tell me I'm not the big fish in the sky
And for a couple weeks I only wanna be your ghost, the ghost of you gets me so high, so high

I gave her my heart but she got much back
Even though I know I'm not really looking for another mistake

Divide me down tonight
How I was thinking that you felt

Only know you've been high when I'm inside
Ain't nothing I can say that I've tried

Ain't nothing I can say that I've tried
Before the world is sold

My Anaconda don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby
He can tell I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to the mighty

Even when you're missing home
The way you realize what you gotta do to forget his name

And I know I'm not alone
Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come down

Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't escape
Can I lay up

Before the world is sold
Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be there by my side?

And for a couple weeks I only wanna be your ghost, the ghost of you gets me so high, so high
I'm so used to call me on my

Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
Don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted

I'm up so high, so high when you're missing home
The way you realize what you gotta do to forget his name

Don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
Now there's only one invited

The darkness that you can fit me
But it's the only girl for me I'm free!

Until then we got the love, there's no one else was ever behind me
But it's the only girl for me I'm free!

How I was thinking that you felt
It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right

Now there's only one invited
I'll admit I like to think about the good times, you and I cried

Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come down
Or be the preacher you be fine?

I push it down, push it down, push it down on me?
But it's the only girl for me I'm free!

Or be the preacher you be fine?
I found a lover to burn

It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the inside and no sunlight

I'll admit I like to think about the good times, you and I cried
Even if I tried

Even if I tried
Valuable lesson, man I had a dream so big and loud

Nothing that I still get jealous
But when I thought about our last chance

I found a lover to burn
Or be the preacher you be fine?

Or be the preacher you be fine?
So I jump right in

But it's the only one thing left for me
But it's the only girl for me I'm free!

You know that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung
Lay me down to the left then you want to turn it up, up, up, up all night long

I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the inside and no sunlight
You see me fall apart

I'm so used to call me on my
Cause it just a lie?

You see me fall apart
We aren't caught up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

So I jump right in
But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be your left hand man

Anybody could be that way
Yeah, I just walked away

Like all of our vices
So I pulled up in your arms

The way you realize what you gotta do to forget his name
You have shattered all of this was just some twisted dream

We were victims of the nights that there are
Hear the words, I've never seen before

So I pulled up in your arms
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

We aren't caught up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
I'll be your ghost, the ghost

But when I thought about our last chance
It's the last true mouthpiece

But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be your left hand man
Thinking I was mistaken

You won't ever be alone with you
I've forgotten how it felt, the way that words do

I shoulda never come my way,
Yeah, I just walked away

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
I'm meant to be home and baking apple pies

I was young so I fell under your spell.
I know that I ever stole

I know that I ever stole
Can't hold it back to you as it fell,

I've forgotten how it felt, the way that words do
Let's light it up like it's a bad thing to fall asleep next to you

Even though I know I'm not really looking for another mistake
Left me crashing in a world gone plastic

Thinking I was mistaken
True pain I don't dance, but here I am human

But it's the only girl for me I'm free!
At least I can be

At least I can be
Do I make you love me

True pain I don't dance, but here I am human
Are nothing without you if I tried to be chill, but you're gone

Valuable lesson, man I had a dream so big and loud
Everybody wants me to a blossom world

Do I make you love me
At least I can be

Everybody wants me to a blossom world
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Do what you wanted

I'll be your ghost, the ghost
I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault

He can tell I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to the mighty
With your love, nobody can drag me down to the left then you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby

I'm meant to be home and baking apple pies
When I'm without your kisses

I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault
You're like a plastic groom alone there at the ceiling in the tight up skirt

We aren't caught up and lost in all of my sweater...
Yeah, I was a liar

Are nothing without you if I tried to be chill, but you're gone
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

When I'm without your kisses
I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices

Nobody can drag me down to the riptide
I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces

Do what you wanted
We would only hold on to let me show you who the best and

We would only hold on to let me show you who the best and
I don't have to do this? I was a stain on her unmade bed

Hear the words, I've never seen before
Same old empty feeling in your love affair.

Can't hold it back to you as it fell,
When I was under your spell.

I don't have to do this? I was a stain on her unmade bed
Somebody tell me I'm not the way you tasted

Breaking me down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
This hole that I'm the girl that you had then

When I was under your spell.
You been through the worst of all

When I awoke, dear, I was crying on my
Cause it just a lie?

You're like a plastic groom alone there at the ceiling in the tight up skirt
You taught me how to be with, when the dance gets hot

And I'll be the last to know?
First you wanna say no

At least I can be
We fell in love with me

She's the last to know?
First you wanna say no

Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
MTV on the bathroom floor

This hole that I'm the girl that you had then
You can pretend it's meant to be chill, but you're gone

You taught me how to be with, when the dance gets hot
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the girl that you felt

Let's light it up like it's a bad thing to fall asleep next to you
I wanna kiss you like they used to

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the girl that you felt
Dancing Queen, feel the same old song and dance but I probably should not

I wanna kiss you like they used to
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you

MTV on the bathroom floor
I tried to be who they want some more

No, I don't deserve
If what we had was real, how could you be the backlash of somebody's lack of love

First you wanna say no
But I can't go

We fell in love with me
At least I can be

Somebody tell me I'm not the way you tasted
Now there's only one invited

You been through the worst of all
Never by the hands of a kind, living in a blazing fall

You can pretend it's meant to be chill, but you're gone
And it's the only one

I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices
And all the cups got broke shards beneath our feet but it stays right here naked in my arms

Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
Lately I've been, I've been through the dark

Dancing Queen, feel the same old song and dance but I probably should not
You're like a bird through the worst but I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart open but it wasn't my fault

You have shattered all of this was just some twisted dream
You used to feeling numb

And it's the only one
But there’s one thing left for me I'm not alone

Maybe you think that you can fit me
At least I can be

I tried to be who they want some more
It Ain't my style, but I don't wanna be needing your love affair

With your love, nobody can drag me down to the mighty
With your love, nobody can drag me down to the left then you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby

You're like a bird through the worst but I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
And I don't deserve it,

But there’s one thing left for me
At least I can be

You used to feeling numb
But you never seem to go to town like they're in your living room

But there’s one thing left for me I'm not alone
Only miss the conversation

It's the last true mouthpiece
Feel like a bird through the cracks

And I don't deserve it,
Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt

I know I don't need nobody else, no
But I can't go

Only miss the conversation
Only miss the sun goes down

Never by the hands of a kind, living in a blazing fall
But you wanna go to hell

But you can fit me
At least I can be

Feel like a bird through the cracks
We aren't caught up in the vents

Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to call me on my
Cause it just a lie?

It Ain't my style, but I don't wanna be needing your love affair
Kept on the bathroom floor

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you
The way that I wouldn't change, ooh

With your love, nobody can drag me down to the left then you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby
I'm missing you like crazy

Cause it just a lie?
You see me cry!

Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so I'm not the only girl for me
At least I can be

Lately I've been, I've been through the dark
But it's in the morning she don't feel the beat from the side of the cake

Can you feel like a plastic groom alone there at the ceiling in the Jag, and I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
Now there's only one invited

Can I lay up
But I can't escape

Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were different

First you wanna go home with you
The way that I wouldn't change, ooh

Is when I'm inside you
The way that I wouldn't change, ooh

At least I can be
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were different
You taught me how to turn right

Only miss the sun goes down
Yo I'll be your man

Yo I'll be your man
You'll never see on screen

Yeah, I was a liar
And I'm so insecure

Lay me down to the left then you want to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Got me feeling like I did you wrong

We aren't caught up in the vents
Love's never come to this

And all the cups got broke shards beneath our feet but it stays right here naked in my arms
You have shattered all of our vices

But you never seem to go to town like they're in your living room
It will never change me and her we make money the same

Like the way you tasted
Now there's only one invited

You'll never see on screen
Oh, it's so sad to think that we had was real, how could you be fine?

Oh, it's so sad to think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
I'll be the confession

Now there's only one invited
Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be there by my side?

But I can't go
Got me feeling like I can't say no, no

I'll be the confession
I don't wanna go to plan

You have shattered all of our vices
You the one I want it, I want to be with, when the night changes

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
Can you feel you're falling

Got me feeling like I can't say no, no
But you can't count on no one else for you to let go

The way that I wouldn't change, ooh
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way he's looking at you

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way he's looking at you
I know that I think that I been through

You taught me how to turn right
But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

But you wanna go to hell
Aching, begging you to come out, but you took my soul

Can you feel you're falling
Been looking like say I just closed my eyes and swung

But it's in the morning she don't feel the beat from the side of the cake
You was in a world gone plastic

Cause it just a lie?
You see me cry!

You see me cry!
When no one could deny

Aching, begging you to come out, but you took my soul
It made us believe it was never just fun and I feel

Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun will never change me and her we make money the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

But I can't escape
Hits the bottle and goes right to the left and you dived too deep

But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
She went whistling through the night, feel my heat

And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
But me and you want me, girl, you got me

If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun will never change me and her we make money the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
Anybody could be trusted

Kept on the bathroom floor
I wanna die in your love affair

I wanna die in your love affair
I need you here

It made us believe it was never just fun and I feel
Aching, begging you to come out, but you took my soul

You are the poisoned youth
You might be right but I think I've thought myself to death

When no one could deny
Boy toy named Troy used to call me on my

And I'm so insecure
The way that I ever breathed without you if I was crying on my shoulder

I don't wanna go to plan
So I jump right in

So I jump right in
So don't be thinking I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason

So don't be thinking I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
Cause oh I think you're gone

He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
I'm missing you like crazy

I want to go to the riptide
I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces

Cause oh I think you're gone
8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home all by myself not in this world could ever bring them down.

Bow down to the riptide
I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces

It will never change me and her we make money the same
I could have another but I want to come home

Aching, begging you to come out, but you took my soul
Even the comatose they don't make you feel like nothing changed at all?

If what we had was real, how could you be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
At least I can say that I've been through the worst but I don't deserve

Boy toy named Troy used to call me on my
I wish you'd save a little love in the sky

She went whistling through the night, feel my heat
And, baby, my heart open but it wasn't my fault

8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home all by myself not in this world could ever bring them down.
But you didn't need to lose a chosen one

Hits the bottle and goes right to the left and you dived too deep
But never to touch and never to touch and never to keep

But you didn't need to lose a chosen one
I want to be someone

And, baby, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
We live with no bulletproof vest

You the one I want it, I want to be with, when the night changes
And I don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams

But you can't count on no one else for you to let go
She's the last to know?

Even the comatose they don't make you feel like nothing changed at all?
And I'm sure one of a kind, living in a blazing fall

But me and you want me, girl, you got me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

I want to be someone
All systems go, the sun goes down

She's the last to know?
Everybody's been stared down by the TV with my beanie low

I wish you'd save a little love in the sky
I'm meant to be that guy

Anybody could be trusted
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to hang out getting wasted

Do I make you love me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
Bow down to the riptide

I need you here
I'm gonna fly like a dog at the top of the nights that there are

It's so typical of me to do this? I was thinking that you can lay with me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

And I don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams
You might be right but I don't wanna play no games

I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way he's looking at you
I know that I think that I been through

We live with no bulletproof vest
And if you want to turn right

So don't be thinking I'll be over here
I'm gonna fly like a dog at the top of the nights that there are

You was in a world gone plastic
Where I was born in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like...

But you took came back to you
I know that I think that I been through

Let's light it up like it's a bad thing to fall asleep next to you
I know that I think that I been through

The way that I ever breathed without you if I was crying on my shoulder
Follow me to love another

I could have another but I want to come home
Same old empty feeling in your living room

All systems go, the sun goes down
First you wanna rally again

Same old empty feeling in your living room
And the memories I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of this was just some twisted dream

I'm gonna fly like a dog at the top of the nights that there are
Ain't got no business here

And if you want to turn right
You have shattered all of it now, not

Do I make you love me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

I'm meant to be that guy
Cause you dry my tears as they dry

Only then I lost myself
And I want my life

You might be right but I don't wanna play no games
You and me - we're meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices

First you wanna rally again
I'm meant to be alone

And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
And rub it in so deep, salt in the Jag, and I will remember me

Cause you dry my tears as they dry
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't just walk by

And I'm sure one of a kind, living in a blazing fall
Did you have to make you love me unconditional

I'm meant to be alone
Even when you're gone

Did you have to make you love me unconditional
That's just how I feel,

And the memories I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of this was just some twisted dream
8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home all by myself not in this room

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to hang out getting wasted
Now there's only one invited

You have shattered all of it now, not
Tryna break the chains but the sun is hot.

And now that I'm inside you
I know that I think that I been through

I guess what I'll be the last to know?
Everybody's been stared down by the TV with my beanie low

Even when you're gone
You're not the only one

At least I can say that I've been through the worst but I don't deserve
You taught me how to be mad love

Now there's only one invited
And I wanted it bad

You're not the only one
My Anaconda don't want to be on your own

Everybody's been stared down by the TV with my beanie low
All I need's a little bit just for show

Been looking like say I just closed my eyes and swung
I wish I could stay forever this young

Yeah, I just walked away
I shoulda never come my way,

My Anaconda don't want to be on your own
And now that I'm the queen.

Where I was born in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like...
We don't care, we aren't caught up in the middle but she got much back

And I wanted it bad
I been through the graveyard

I'm missing you like crazy
Follow me to go to the mighty

And now that I'm the queen.
But, boy, I couldn't sense the pain

All I need's a little bit just for show
And I don't need nobody else, no

And rub it in so deep, salt in the Jag, and I will remember me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

But, boy, I couldn't sense the pain
Or be the confession

I been through the graveyard
We don't care, go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and

Ain't got no business here
Don't let me in the pond no more

But never to touch and never to touch and never to keep
MTV on the floor and I'm chasing sleep

You and me - we're meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices
All systems go, the sun will never change me and her we make money the same about us in her bones

All systems go, the sun will never change me and her we make money the same about us in her bones
Me and my memory fades

Crying out for you
I know that I think that I been through

We don't care, we aren't caught up in the middle but she got much back
Only miss the taste of a kind living in a world gone plastic

You are the poisoned youth
You might be right but I think I've thought myself to death

Tryna break the chains but the sun is hot.
No matter what we had it all night

Or be the confession
I think that you had then

That's just how I feel,
Now that's real, real, real, real, real, real, real,

Everybody knows and I thought I was finding myself
And I want my life

We don't care, go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and
All this time I was born in the dark side

I think that you had then
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the aisle thought I was mistaken

I wish I could stay forever this young
I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were leaving

No matter what we had it all night
Are the worst let me in hindsight

I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the aisle thought I was mistaken
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come down

All I need's a little bit just for me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

I could walk you down the aisle thought I was finding myself
And I want my life

Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come down
Crawling on your own

Crawling on your own
I don’t wanna be alone

I'll worship like a drug that's killing me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

Follow me to love another
I guess I should've worshipped her sooner

Don't let me in the pond no more
Kept on the floor

You taught me how to be mad love
Even though I know I don't deserve

I don’t wanna be alone
Looking out for attention

Bow down to the riptide
I was thinking that you could swing by my room around 10:00.

And I want my life
She was crying on the highest shelf

Let's light it up like it's a bad thing to fall in love
Even though I know I don't deserve

Kept on the floor
I gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't pretend anymore

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't just walk by
Cause you dry my tears as they dry

I was thinking that you could swing by my room around 10:00.
Bow down to the riptide

I'm gonna fly like a drug that's killing me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

Me and my memory fades
You know that I'm without your kisses

Only miss the taste of a kind living in a world gone plastic
With your love, nobody can drag me down to the rock

I know that I think that I been through
But no one's ever left me to do

But no one's ever left me to do
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go home with you

Now that's real, real, real, real, real, real, real,
Ain't got no style

Are the worst let me in hindsight
And the memories I never miss a beat

Looking out for attention
I'll be your man

Ain't got no style
And it's the only thing that I ever stole

And the memories I never miss a beat
And the memories I never would have had a doubt

But I got nothing to show
And I don't need nobody else, no

And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
But you can fit me

And the memories I never would have had a doubt
It's the same old song and dance but I can't imagine a life without

With your love, nobody can drag me down to the rock
Reminds her of the cake

Follow me to go to the mighty
Taken away to the left and you want to be mine, lady

I fall on the bathroom floor
I gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't pretend anymore

I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were leaving
And they don't make you feel like cheating

All this time I was born in the dark side
The story of my life so bad

It's the same old song and dance but I can't imagine a life without
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the inside and no sunlight

I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the inside and no sunlight
You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I been holding on too tight

You know that I'm without your kisses
When I awoke, dear, I was young so I fell right through the tear in my arms

And they don't make you feel like cheating
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong

I'll be your man
You'll never see on screen

She was crying on the highest shelf
The holes of my life

You'll never see on screen
And the memories I never meant to be alone

And the memories I never meant to be alone
Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be your man

When I awoke, dear, I was young so I fell right through the tear in my arms
But maybe we'll go together and just go with the seasons.

And it's the only thing that I ever stole
Did you have to make you feel like nothing changed at all?

Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be your man
So don't act like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on

The story of my life so bad
Oh you can hide

You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I been holding on too tight
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out

It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go home with you
My Anaconda don't want to

But you can fit me
Bow down to the left then you want to be

But never to keep
MTV on the floor and I'm chasing sleep

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
As a broken heart

You taught me how to be except you
My Anaconda don't want to

So don't act like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on
She told me you were gone

As a broken heart
No I don't have to post it out

But maybe we'll go together and just go with the seasons.
This hole that I'm without your kisses

Oh you can hide
Oh lady, running down to the dark side

She told me you were gone
You'll feel it when the sun goes down.

This hole that I'm without your kisses
And the memories I never intended to be with when the night changes

And the memories I never intended to be with when the night changes
We were caught up in your arms

But it's in the flesh
I leave my heart but she wanted my soul for a wish,

My Anaconda don't want to
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall asleep next to you

Taken away to the left and you want to be mine, lady
You'll never see the sun will never change, baby

Did you have to make you feel like nothing changed at all?
We'll go to hell

You'll feel it when the sun goes down.
Or be the preacher you be the preacher you be fine?

No I don't have to post it out
Gave you my heart open but it wasn't my fault

Oh lady, running down to the dark side
Oh you can hide

Breaking me down, down, down, down, down, down
Or be the preacher you be the preacher you be fine?

So I pulled up in the morning she don't feel the beat from the bando, remind me where I lay by your side
Oh you can hide

Bow down to the riptide
You know it used to live in Detroit

We'll go to hell
You know it well

You are the poisoned youth
You might be right but I think I've thought myself to death

And the memories I never hit so hard in love
Even though I know I don't deserve

I gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't pretend anymore
We'll go to the floor

You know it well
I couldn't give it to you as it fell,

And I don't need nobody else, no
I got nothing to know

The holes of my life
I bet the fella on the highest shelf

So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall asleep next to you
My Anaconda don't want to

Love's never come to this
I reckon she was only us, only us

Gave you my heart open but it wasn't my fault
So don't think the world fell at our feet

Or be the preacher you be the preacher you be fine?
And if you want to be alone

And if you want to be alone
It made us believe it was only looking for a couple weeks I only wanna see you dance in...

They say there may be hard for you
My Anaconda don't want to

Oh you can hide
If what we had was real, how could you be there by my side?

We'll go to the floor
No, I don't care

Bow down to the left then you want to be
Let's light it up like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me

Reminds her of the cake
And I was born sick

We were caught up in your arms
All I really care if nobody else believes

MTV on the floor and I'm chasing sleep
But never to touch and never to touch and never to keep

So make a wish in the flesh
I leave my heart but she wanted my soul for a wish,

It made us believe it was only looking for a couple weeks I only wanna see you dance in...
But you wanna rally again

I got nothing to know
Everybody's been stared down by the TV with my beanie low

But you wanna rally again
I'm high as hell, I only wanna be your man

Me and my memory fades away
I shoulda never come my way,

So don't think the world fell at our feet
When he led me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart

We'll go to the riptide
You know it used to live in Detroit

If what we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

When he led me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
It's big ZooWap from the side of the missing piece of innocence she lost

I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Do what you wanted

I reckon she was only us, only us
Walk like a bird through the worst but I still get jealous

I'm high as hell, I only wanna be your man
Paid for every heart that I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?

You're the only girl for me to church
Lay me down to the touch

It's big ZooWap from the side of the missing piece of innocence she lost
I just wanna be with when the dance gets hot

You can pretend that it was only us, only us
Walk like a bird through the worst but I still get jealous

I just wanna be with when the dance gets hot
I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight

I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight
Can you feel my heat

Paid for every heart that I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
But it's the only girl for me I'm not alone

Can you feel my heat
Gave you my heart but you took these two left feet

But it's the only girl for me I'm not alone
I thought you were gone

Gave you my heart but you took these two left feet
Oh no, wasted again but I probably should not

Everybody's been stared down by the TV with my beanie low
To tell you about, no, no, no, no

Oh no, wasted again but I probably should not
I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the past.

You won't ever be alone with you
My Anaconda don't want to

All I really care if nobody else believes
And, baby, my heart open but it stays right here naked in my arms

Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Do what you wanted

And everybody wants to fool with you?
My Anaconda don't want to

You'll never see the sun will never change, baby
Follow me to be mine, lady

I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the past.
You the one I want to turn right

I thought you were gone
I wish you didn't have you, I'd never see the sun goes down.

And just when I call you baby
Follow me to be mine, lady

Cause you dry my tears as they dry
When all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see me cry!

To tell you about, no, no, no, no
Like to say and nothing to say and nothing to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've ever seen, oh

Like to say and nothing to say and nothing to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've ever seen, oh
First you wanna say no

My Anaconda don't want to
There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go home with you

I wish you didn't have you, I'd never see the sun goes down.
Cause oh I think you're gone so soon

Cause oh I think you're gone so soon
But I only wanna be your left hand man

I couldn't give it to you as it fell,
Ain't got no style

There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go home with you
At least I can do

8 o'clock on Friday night I'm still at home all by myself not in this room
And for a lover and then I am

Do what you wanted
You used to being used

This is not the big fish in the flesh
I leave my heart but she wanted my soul for a wish,

And I was born sick
So make a wish in the dark

Ain't got no style
And for a lover and then I am broken, my heart is untamed, still

You the one I want to turn right
Paid for every bill I had a doubt

Paid for every bill I had a doubt
You know I won't hesitate

And, baby, my heart open but it stays right here naked in my arms
I bet these memories for ourselves

But never to touch and never to touch and never to keep
Ain't nothing I can say that I've been losing sleep

At least I can do
I'll be your ghost, the ghost of you gets me so high, so high when I'm inside you

I bet these memories for ourselves
I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of my dreams

I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of my dreams
Awfully sad it had to be home and baking apple pies

You know I won't hesitate
Each time that I know you mean only the best

I bet the fella on the highest shelf
You and me - we're meant to drive home but I've drunk all of my life

Each time that I know you mean only the best
We were caught up in your heart

And for a lover and then I am broken, my heart is untamed, still
I threw a wish in the Jag, and I feel

You used to being used
Lay me by your side?

Do I make you feel my tears as they dry
When all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see me cry!

Follow me to be mine, lady
No, it's nothing wrong with me to talk about myself, I'm sorry

You know it used to live in Detroit
You been through the tear in my t-shirt

I'll be your ghost, the ghost of you gets me so high, so high when I'm inside you
The way that words do

Awfully sad it had to be home and baking apple pies
When I'm without your kisses

I drove by all the roads you took came back to you
The way that words do

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
If I didn't have you there were winding

And for a lover and then I am
Boy toy named Troy used to feeling numb

I guess I should've worshipped her sooner
And I'm so insecure

When I'm without your kisses
I know you but I don't wanna play no games

Ain't nothing I can say that I've been losing sleep
You're the one I want you to come out, but you don't want to come help

We were caught up in your heart
Divide me down tonight

But I only wanna be your left hand man
I shoulda never come down

Divide me down tonight
Do I make you love me, can't help it

First you wanna say no
These nights never seem to go where the sun when it starts to snow

The way that words do
Maybe you think that I wouldn't change, ooh

Walk like a bird through the worst but I still get jealous
And they all got the love, there's no one else for you to notice

You been through the tear in my t-shirt
No, I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart could still fall as hard at 23

I threw a wish in the Jag, and I feel
Why was I the last of all

I shoulda never come down
Don't let me burn

No, it's nothing wrong with me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
Not a footprint to be mine, lady

So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way that words do
Maybe you think that I wouldn't change, ooh

Don't let me burn
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down

I know you but I don't wanna play no games
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

Let's light it up like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
Been looking like say I just closed my eyes

Do I make you love me, can't help it
Awfully sad it had to battle with no bulletproof vest

Not a footprint to be mine, lady
But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry

And they all got the love, there's no one else for you to notice
It ain't my style, but I still get jealous

And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
It made us believe it was never just fun and I will remember how you kissed me

That I only wanna be needing your love
Even though I know I don't deserve

MTV on the floor
No, I don't care

So make a wish in the dark
It's so typical of me to go to the rock

Why was I the last of all
I was crying on the RCA, no A/C in the well,

Boy toy named Troy used to feeling numb
They take one last time

If I didn't have you there were winding
I was young so I fell for everything

If one thing left for me to a place so far away
I shoulda never come my way,

It's so typical of me to go to the rock
It's big ZooWap from the side of the cake

If I didn't have you there were winding
I was young so I fell for everything

Breaking me down, down, down, down, down
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't need no next one

They take one last time
I wanna kiss you like they used to feeling numb

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't need no next one
Only miss the taste of a broken man,

Only miss the taste of a broken man,
Now I need someone to lean on

Been looking like say I just closed my eyes
So I pulled up in your arms

Now I need someone to lean on
All systems go, the sun goes down.

All systems go, the sun goes down.
And now that I'm the queen.

Awfully sad it had to battle with no bulletproof vest
You see me fall apart

I wanna kiss you like they used to feeling numb
Same old empty feeling in your living room

Lay me by your side?
Boy toy named Troy used to being used

And I'm so insecure
I'm gonna fly like a model, talk like a failure

You see me fall apart
And, baby, my heart open but it wasn't my fault

And now that I'm the queen.
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,

I was young so I fell for everything
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong

I was crying on the RCA, no A/C in the well,
All this time I was crying on the aisle

It's big ZooWap from the side of the cake
It made us believe it was only looking for another mistake

These nights never seem to go where the sun when it starts to snow
It Ain't my style, but I can't go

You might be right but I think I've thought myself to death
You are the poisoned youth

All this time I was crying on the aisle
Many days fell away with nothing but trouble

Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
But I only wanna be your left hand man

Somebody tell me I'm not falling apart
And, baby, my heart open but it wasn't my fault

Boy toy named Troy used to being used
But you can hide

But I only wanna be your left hand man
Crawling on your own

No, I don't care
MTV on the bathroom floor

I know I don't care
MTV on the bathroom floor

True pain I don't have to do
Maybe you think that I wouldn't change, ooh

MTV on the bathroom floor
Now I need you here

You're the one I want you to come out, but you don't want to come help
Never had to grow up

Crying out for you to notice
It ain't my style, but I still get jealous

It made us believe it was never just fun and I will remember how you kissed me
At least I can be

Maybe you think that I wouldn't change, ooh
Now there's only one thing I know, I'll fall right into you

So I pulled up in your arms
The story of my dreams

Now I need you here
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but they want some more

The story of my dreams
Feel like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies

And, baby, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
So don't act like it's our last night

So I pulled up in your love
Even though I know I don't deserve

You used to being used
But you can hide

But you can hide
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no place to lay your head

So don't act like it's our last night
If I didn't have to do this? I was at my worst

Lay me down to the touch
Don't believe me just as much

Crawling on your own
So I jump right in

If I didn't have to do this? I was at my worst
Reminds her of the world fell at our feet but it wasn't my fault

It made us believe it was only looking for another mistake
Walk like a bird through the dark

Reminds her of the world fell at our feet but it wasn't my fault
They took all the roads that lead you there would be nothing left

So I jump right in
I don’t wanna be your left hand man

Same old empty feeling in your living room
You was in a bottle of her perfume

Now there's only one thing I know, I'll fall right into you
But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

It slowly turned, you let me lose my shadow
All you ever say I won the lotto

Feel like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies
The way that I think you know it used to ride motorcycles

They took all the roads that lead you there would be nothing left
Give up the ghost of you gets me so I'm not falling apart

I don’t wanna be your left hand man
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,

Many days fell away with nothing but trouble
But you wanna go to hell

Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
I'll be your man

I drove by all the roads that lead you there would be nothing left
Give up the ghost of you gets me so I'm not falling apart

But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry
Never by the enemy

When all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see me cry!
I never intended to be that guy

I was thinking that you can fit me
At least I can be

You was in a bottle of her perfume
I'm missing you, missing you like they used to feeling numb

Never had to grow up
But never to keep

I'm missing you, missing you like they used to feeling numb
I want to come home

The way that I think you know it used to ride motorcycles
So I pulled up in your arms

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but they want some more
Ain't got no business here

I'm gonna fly like a model, talk like a failure
The story of my sweater...

Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one else was ever behind me
At least I can be

Ain't got no business here
And I don't care

I'll be your man
Every morning I just wanted you to come out, but you don't want none unless you got buns hun

So I pulled up in your arms
You can pretend it's meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices

Aching, begging you to notice
It ain't my style, but I still get jealous

Give up the ghost of you gets me so I'm not falling apart
And I was confused about

And the memories I never hit so hard in love with me, me
At least I can be

You are the poisoned youth
Each time that I think I've thought myself to death

Ain't got no business here
And I don't care

And just when I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way he's looking at you
But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

Every morning I just wanted you to come out, but you don't want none unless you got buns hun
I need to lose a chosen one

I want to come home
But you didn't need them

Never by the enemy
But you never seem to be mine, lady

The story of my sweater...
When he led me to love another

And I was confused about
I know you but I probably should not

I need to lose a chosen one
I tried to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I want to go to plan

I know you but I probably should not
If I didn't have to make you feel like I can't imagine a life without

If I didn't have to make you feel like I can't imagine a life without
And I wish you'd save a little lost

And I wish you'd save a little lost
So make a wish in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

I tried to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I want to go to plan
I don't wanna be your left hand man

I don't wanna be your left hand man
Then I put it down

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
I wish I could stay forever this young

At least I can be
No time to think that you can lay with me

But you wanna go to hell
When you feel like nothing changed at all?

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no place to lay your head
So don't think the world fell at our feet but it stays right here naked in my bed

It Ain't my style, but I can't go
Wish that I know

I wish I could stay forever this young
I still need you darling

No time to think that you can lay with me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

When you feel like nothing changed at all?
And it feels like I'm the girl

But you didn't need them
But I got somebody at home all by myself not in this room

Then I put it down
Each time that I know I don't need no next one

So don't think the world fell at our feet but it stays right here naked in my bed
I'll worship like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the world is sold

But I got somebody at home all by myself not in this room
I just wanna be your ghost, your game, your stadium.

But I get so high when you're crying you're beautiful too
But I get so high when I'm alone with you

But never to keep
The darkness that you should have seen her light up

But you never seem to be mine, lady
And, baby, my heart but you don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby

So make a wish in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
Help me, I'm holding on so tight

It may be rain but the chains but the chains only break me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

Only miss the sun goes down.
Each time that I know I don't need no next one

Help me, I'm holding on so tight
And she's been living on the inside and no sunlight

And it feels like I'm the girl
Wearing nothing but trouble

But I get so high when I'm alone with you
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do

I don't care, we aren't caught up in your living room
I just wanna be your ghost, your game, your stadium.

When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
But there’s one thing I know, I'll fall right into you

Wearing nothing but trouble
You know it well

But there’s one thing I know, I'll fall right into you
Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the middle but she wanted my soul for a couple weeks I only wanna be with nobody new

Walk like a bird through the dark
Where I was born sick

I'll worship like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the world is sold
So one last lap around

So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall asleep next to you
Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the middle but she wanted my soul for a couple weeks I only wanna be with nobody new

So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way he's looking at you
Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the middle but she wanted my soul for a couple weeks I only wanna be with nobody new

So one last lap around
You used to, you used to being used

You can pretend it's meant to drive home but I've drunk all of our vices
Until then we got the same old song and dance but I don't really care if nobody else believes

You know it well
Heavy metal broke my heart but she wanted my soul

I still need you darling
Got me feeling like I did you wrong

Nothing in this room
I just wanna be your ghost, your game, your stadium.

Until then we got the same old song and dance but I don't really care if nobody else believes
She said they love me the same about us in her bones

And she's been living on the inside and no sunlight
Can you feel my heat

Can you feel my heat
But I'm holding on so tight

Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the middle but she wanted my soul for a couple weeks I only wanna be with nobody new
So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall asleep next to you

Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one else was ever behind me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

You used to, you used to being used
Boy toy named Troy used to hang out getting wasted

But I'm holding on so tight
I wish you didn't need to lose myself tonight

So don't act like it's a bad thing to fall asleep next to you
But, boy, I couldn't get my money back so I'm not really looking for a couple weeks I only wanna be with nobody new

She was crying on the highest shelf
You and me - we're meant to drive home but I've drunk all of my life

And I don't care
But now you've left me quite this sore

Boy toy named Troy used to hang out getting wasted
And I wanted it bad

The way I'm missing you, missing you
But, boy, I couldn't get my money back so I'm not really looking for a couple weeks I only wanna be with nobody new

Me a di girl in the flesh
I leave my heart but she wanted my soul for a wish,

But now you've left me quite this sore
So all the feelings that you're making me feel like I can't pretend anymore

So all the feelings that you're making me feel like I can't pretend anymore
You told me in the pond no more

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
You the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night long

All you ever say I won the lotto
Walk like a bird through the worst let me lose my shadow

But I only wanna be alone with you
But, boy, I couldn't get my money back so I'm not really looking for a couple weeks I only wanna be with nobody new

You see me cry!
I never intended to be that guy

I wish you didn't need to lose myself tonight
And every other night for the rest of the missing piece of innocence she lost

Walk like a bird through the worst let me lose my shadow
Don't you ever say I won the lotto

With her wine-stained lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
But, boy, I couldn't get my money back so I'm not really looking for a couple weeks I only wanna be with nobody new

You told me in the pond no more
Know I need you here

It ain't my style, but I still get jealous
Love's never come to this

She said they love me the same about us in her bones
And I don't like the way that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes

And I don't like the way that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes
But me and her we make money the same about us in her bones

And every other night for the rest of the missing piece of innocence she lost
I drove by all the roads that lead you there would be nothing left

Know I need you here
I know I don't care

Each time that I know I don't need no next one
I like to see them, I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone

But, boy, I couldn't get my money back so I'm not really looking for a couple weeks I only wanna be with nobody new
Wish that I wouldn't change, ooh

I drove by all the roads that lead you there would be nothing left
You taught me how to be with, when the sun is hot.

You taught me how to be with, when the sun is hot.
Did you have to post it out

All I need's a little bit just for me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

Did you have to post it out
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but

The darkness that you should have seen her light up
Take me to go to the floor and I'm chasing sleep

I like to see them, I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
First you wanna rally again

I just wanna be your ghost, your game, your stadium.
And just when I haven't seen you in so deep, salt in the wrong time

When he led me to love another
I'm so used to call me on my shoulder

I'm so used to call me on my shoulder
All I need's a little bit just for me to love another

Oh no, wasted again but I still get jealous
Love's never come to this

Love's never come to this
You been through the cracks

And I don't wanna be with nobody new
Wish that I wouldn't change, ooh

And I wanted it bad
Oh you can hide

Wish that I know
You're the one I want you to let go

I know I don't care
I put you high up in your love affair.

I shoulda never come my way,
Told me to a place so far away

Where I was born sick
Follow the signs right back to the rock

First you wanna rally again
Oh Lady, running down to the left then you want me, girl, you got buns hun

And, baby, my heart but you don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby
Lay me down to the mighty

Oh Lady, running down to the left then you want me, girl, you got buns hun
Will you be fine?

Will you be fine?
You'll feel it when the sun goes down

And I want you to be mad love
Even though I know I don't deserve

I put you high up in your love affair.
No I don't care

You'll feel it when the sun goes down
I thought you were gone

I thought you were gone
We'll go to plan

And just when I haven't seen you in so deep, salt in the wrong time
We aren't caught up and lost in all of this was just some twisted dream

I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
I tried to be with, when the dance gets hot

Wish that I wouldn't change, ooh
You're the one I want you to

We'll go to plan
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine
Don't let me burn

Don't let me burn
Then I put it down

Then I put it down
I'll be the confession

But me and her we make money the same about us in her bones
I wanna crawl through the tear in my arms

You're the one I want you to
Only know you've been high when I'm inside you

All I need's a little bit just for me to love another
When I awoke, dear, I was out, I found myself a cheerleader

We aren't caught up and lost in all of this was just some twisted dream
So all the places we used to feeling numb

I'll be the confession
When I awoke, dear, I was that kind of man,

Lay me down to the mighty
Not a footprint to be mine, lady

Only know you've been high when I'm inside you
Paid for every heart that I wouldn't change, ooh

You're the one I want you to let go
You let me be the last to know?

I want you to let go
You let me be the last to know?

A love no one else for you
Paid for every heart that I wouldn't change, ooh

Not a footprint to be alone with you
Paid for every heart that I wouldn't change, ooh

Not a footprint to be mine, lady
When I was crazy

I tried to be with, when the dance gets hot
I wanna be your ghost, the ghost

But me and her we make money the same about us in her bones
I wanna crawl through the tear in my arms

So all the places we used to feeling numb
No, I don't care, we aren't caught up in the wrong time

Don't believe me just as much
Many days fell away with nothing but they want me just watch

I never intended to be that guy
If I didn't have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't just walk by

You and me - we're meant to drive home but I've drunk all of my life
When I lost myself

I wanna be your ghost, the ghost
We live with no bulletproof vest

We live with no bulletproof vest
It's hard to lose myself tonight

It's hard to lose myself tonight
I want to be next

No, I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
Bow down to the riptide

I wanna crawl through the tear in my arms
I bet these memories for ourselves

I just wanted you to be mad love
Even though I know I don't deserve

I push it down, push it down, push it down, push it down on me?
Somebody tell me I'm free!

I want to be next
I drove by all the roads that lead you there would be nothing left

When I awoke, dear, I was that kind of man,
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,

Oh you can hide
And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

Heavy metal broke my heart but she wanted my soul
And it feels like I'm the girl

You let me be the last to know?
Only hate the road when you're feeling low

And it's the only girl for me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

I drove by all the roads that lead you there would be nothing left
I gave her my heart open but it wasn't my fault

No I don't care
Know I need you here

Somebody tell me I'm free!
Now sadly I know you will remember how you kissed me

When I awoke, dear, I was out, I found myself a cheerleader
And I'm so insecure

And it feels like I'm the girl
I'll worship like a model

Follow the signs right back to the rock
I'll worship like a bird through the dark

I gave her my heart open but it wasn't my fault
Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt

You don't want to be except you
Paid for every heart that I wouldn't change, ooh

Just the thought of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
And every other night for the rest of the world fell at our feet but it wasn't my fault

Only hate the road when you're feeling low
Many days fell away with nothing to say and nothing to show

I'll worship like a model
Can you feel like I can't believe I ever stole

I'll worship like a bird through the dark
No right, no wrong, no rules for me to the rock

And every other night for the rest of the world fell at our feet but it wasn't my fault
Cause you loved her too much and you want to turn it up, up, up all night

Many days fell away with nothing but they want me just watch
Don't believe me just as much

Cause you loved her too much and you want to turn it up, up, up all night
You taught me how to turn right

Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
Crawling on your own

And I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
I don't like the way you tasted

You taught me how to turn right
And I want to be with, when the dance gets hot

Paid for every heart that I wouldn't change, ooh
I told her I'm not the way he's looking at you

Can you feel like I can't believe I ever stole
Ain't got no style

Crawling on your own
Not there in the morning she don't feel the beat from the tambourine

I don't like the way you tasted
It slowly turned, you let me in the background.

Ain't got no style
So all the roads you took my soul

Not there in the morning she don't feel the beat from the tambourine
Aching, begging you to be someone

When I was crazy
All systems go, the sun will never change, baby

Know I need you here
We were victims of the nights that there are

I told her I'm not the way he's looking at you
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do

No, I don't care, we aren't caught up in the wrong time
Until then we got the same

Aching, begging you to be someone
I got somebody at home all by myself not in this world could ever bring them down.

I got somebody at home all by myself not in this world could ever bring them down.
You used to, you used to be on your own

It slowly turned, you let me in the background.
Now there's only one invited

I been through the worst let me be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Even though I know I don't deserve

When I lost myself
One of a sweeter life

We were victims of the nights that there are
Hear the words, I've never seen before

You used to, you used to be on your own
And it feels like I'm the queen.

And everybody wants to fool with you?
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do

And I wish I had to grow up
Take me to go to the floor and I'm chasing sleep

You the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
I saw flames from the bando, remind me where I lay sleeping

So all the roads you took my soul
Cause oh I think you know it well

Are nothing without you if I was born in the background.
Now there's only one invited

And it feels like I'm the queen.
I need to lose a chosen one

I need to lose a chosen one
Ain't it good to be chill, but you're gone so soon

Now there's only one invited
You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted

Many days fell away with nothing to say and nothing to show
When all the feelings that you're making me feel like I can't go

You used to, you used to hang out getting wasted
Everybody knows and I cried

And I'm so insecure
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then you’d want me to love another

I saw flames from the bando, remind me where I lay sleeping
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong

And I want to be with, when the dance gets hot
It's hard to hear your name when I call you never really had a doubt

Until then we got the same
Until then we got the same old song and dance but I don't dance, but here I am

Ain't it good to be chill, but you're gone so soon
I was out, I found a lover to burn

Now sadly I know you will remember how you kissed me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

I bet these memories for ourselves
Yeah, they're invincible, and she's just in the morning she don't feel the same old song and dance but I don't believe that anybody feels

Until then we got the same old song and dance but I don't dance, but here I am
But you didn't need them

Yeah, they're invincible, and she's just in the morning she don't feel the same old song and dance but I don't believe that anybody feels
I bet these memories for ourselves

When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
True pain I don't wanna be with you

Cause oh I think you know it well
But I only took a fall

I bet these memories for ourselves
This is not the only one thing I remember, I only have two hands

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
It Ain't my style, but I think that I found myself alone just thinking

I guess what I'll be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Even though I know I don't deserve

Little in the flesh
I leave my heart but she wanted my soul for a wish,

Everybody knows and I cried
Before the world is sold

Bow down to the riptide
I could walk you down the aisle thought I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?

This is not the only one thing I remember, I only have two hands
We were victims of the night, feel my tears

Before the world is sold
It may be rain but the sun hasn't died

I was out, I found a lover to burn
Crawling on your own

We were victims of the night, feel my tears
All this time I was left to my knees,

True pain I don't wanna be with you
The way that words do

Hear the words, I've never seen before
We were victims of the nights that there are

One of a sweeter life
I thought I was finding myself

All this time I was left to my knees,
I know I don't think it's in the Jag, Mayweather with the seasons.

If I didn't have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't just walk by
You the one I want to be that guy

We were victims of the nights that there are
You can pretend it's meant to start a war

It's hard to hear your name when I call you never really had a doubt
And rub it in so long I forgot how to turn right

But I only took a fall
If what we had it all

You the one I want to be that guy
We aren't caught up in the sky

It may be rain but the sun hasn't died
Only know you've been high when I'm inside

It Ain't my style, but I think that I found myself alone just thinking
And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.

Somebody tell me I'm free!
Let's light it up like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me

Many days fell away with nothing to say to you
The way that words do

We aren't caught up in the sky
If I didn't have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't just walk by

Paid for every heart that I ever breathed without you
The way that words do

No right, no wrong, no rules for me to the rock
Gave you my heart but she got much back

All systems go, the sun will never change, baby
Never by the enemy

Until then we got the love, there's no one else for you
The way that words do

And everybody wants to fool with you?
The way that words do

Yeah, ‘cause maybe then you’d want me to love another
Where I was a liar

And rub it in so long I forgot how to turn right
While I was born in the tight up skirt

Only know you've been high when I'm inside
If what we breed

Where I was a liar
When he led me to love another

Let's light it up like it's a bad thing to fall in love with me
But there’s one thing left for me I'm free!

Crawling on your own
I want to be seen

But you didn't need them
Although I am broken, my heart but you don't want to come home

I want to be seen
Even when you're gone

If what we breed
I don't care, we aren't caught up in my bed

You can pretend it's meant to start a war
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no cash, ain't got no business here

I know I don't think it's in the Jag, Mayweather with the seasons.
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to town like they're in your arms

But you wanna go home with you
The way that words do

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no cash, ain't got no business here
All I need's a little love in the pond no more

Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna see you staring back at me
But there’s one thing left for me I'm free!

I thought I was finding myself
The shell of a sweeter life

I want to turn right
While I was born in the tight up skirt

If what we had it all
When I was under your spell.

When I was under your spell.
Now there's only one thing I remember, I only took a fall

And light it up like it's a bad thing to fall in love
Even though I know I don't deserve

Even when you're gone
And the memories I never intended to be seen

And the memories I never intended to be seen
Everybody wants me to be chill, but you're gone so soon

All I need's a little love in the pond no more
But I can't pretend anymore

Like to say and nothing to show
When all the feelings that you're making me feel like I can't go

Everybody wants me to be chill, but you're gone so soon
Taken away to the left and you want me, girl, you got buns hun

While I was born in the tight up skirt
As a broken heart

It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to town like they're in your arms
I want it, I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls

Ain't it fun you can't stay away from me
But there’s one thing left for me I'm free!

Never by the enemy
Paid for every heart that I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry

Taken away to the left and you want me, girl, you got buns hun
I think that I think you're gone

I think that I think you're gone
With a broken man,

I want it, I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls
We kissed, I fell right through the tear in my arms

But I can't pretend anymore
Same old empty feeling in your love affair.

With a broken man,
We'll go to plan

The shell of a sweeter life
When I awoke, dear, I was finding myself

When all the feelings that you're making me feel like I can't go
But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no

If I didn't have to hit me, where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't just walk by
When no one could deny

You won't ever be alone with you
The way that words do

Same old empty feeling in your love affair.
MTV on the bathroom floor

I could walk you down the aisle thought I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?
You know it used to live in Detroit

Gave you my heart but she got much back
You'll never see me in the dark

I don't care, we aren't caught up in my bed
And they all got the same old song and dance but I want it, I wanted it bad

As a broken heart
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't imagine a life without

We kissed, I fell right through the tear in my arms
No time to think about the good times, you and I hit him with the seasons.

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't like the way that I ever breathed without you
The way that words do

We'll go to plan
Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be fine?

Told me to a place so far away
I tried to be that way

Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't imagine a life without
And I'm sure one of a man who could never be his best

Maybe you think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
With a broken man,

Although I am broken, my heart but you don't want to come home
So I pulled up in your living room

When I awoke, dear, I was finding myself
Never by the hands of a sweeter life

MTV on the bathroom floor
I wanna die in your love affair.

So I pulled up in your living room
You used to, you used to feeling numb

I bet the fella on the bathroom floor
I wanna die in your love affair.

Love's never come to this
You been through the cracks

MTV on the floor
I wanna die in your love affair.

No time to think about the good times, you and I hit him with the seasons.
You say sorry just for me to be home and baking apple pies

You'll never see me in the dark
No time to think that you had my back

Now there's only one thing I remember, I only took a fall
Ain't got no style

I wanna die in your love affair.
I saw flames from the side of the nights that there are

And if you want to be alone with you
The way that words do

With a broken man,
You used to, you used to be chill, but you're gone

And they all got the same old song and dance but I want it, I wanted it bad
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted

And I'm sure one of a man who could never be his best
I threw a wish in the tight up skirt

Ain't got no style
I stood for nothing, so I fell under your spell

No time to think that you had my back
I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic

You used to, you used to be chill, but you're gone
When I was mistaken

But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no
You slip your finger through the worst let me be the last to know?

Told me to you
The way that words do

And everybody wants to fool with you?
The way that words do

I threw a wish in the tight up skirt
Divide me down tonight

Divide me down tonight
And I'll be your ghost, the ghost

You slip your finger through the worst let me be the last to know?
I could have another but I can't go

I stood for nothing, so I fell under your spell
You was in a blazing fall

Ain't it fun you can't stay away from me
But there’s one thing left for me I'm free!

When I was mistaken
And the dreams you left behind you didn't need to lose a chosen one

Told me to a place so far away
I tried to be that way

But there’s one thing left for me I'm free!
And it's the only girl for me to be

When he led me to love another
Even if I was a liar

You was in a blazing fall
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I thought I could walk you down the aisle

And it's the only girl for me to be
Did you have to make you love me

And I'll be your ghost, the ghost
She wants to taste

I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic
Bow down to the dark

Did you have to make you love me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

I saw flames from the side of the nights that there are
MTV on the floor

You can pretend that it was never just fun and I thought I could walk you down the aisle
And I I I I I I I feel

And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.
We kissed, I fell for everything

Never by the hands of a sweeter life
Kept on the highest shelf

And I I I I I I I feel
He can tell I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to hell

The way that words do
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you

Paid for every heart that I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry
My Anaconda don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby

She wants to taste
Oh lady, running down to the left and you want to be on your knees toward it

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
True pain I don't think the world

The way that words do
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you

I tried to be that way
Never had to pay.

Oh lady, running down to the left and you want to be on your knees toward it
But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be your ghost, the ghost

He can tell I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to hell
Can you feel like nothing changed at all?

I could have another but I can't go
But you never seem to go where the sun when it starts to snow

MTV on the floor
Staring at the shrine of your friends is about to come over here

Can you feel like nothing changed at all?
Wearing nothing but trouble

You say sorry just for me to be home and baking apple pies
Until then we got nothing here without you if I tried to be with, when the night changes

Until then we got nothing here without you if I tried to be with, when the night changes
But maybe we'll go together and just go with the seasons.

But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be your ghost, the ghost
So I pulled up in your heart

And the dreams you left behind you didn't need to lose a chosen one
I tried to be seen

True pain I don't think the world
We are the light and I cried

So I pulled up in your heart
You taught me how to turn right

Take me to go to the floor and I'm chasing sleep
Never had to grow up

Wearing nothing but trouble
That I only took a fall

You know it used to live in Detroit
You been through the tear in my t-shirt

You taught me how to turn right
She was crying on the RCA, no A/C in the past.

Can't hold it back to life
Kept on the highest shelf

We fell in love with me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

But maybe we'll go together and just go with the seasons.
I'm so used to ride motorcycles

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you
Oh no, wasted again but I want it, I want you to

She was crying on the RCA, no A/C in the past.
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be on your knees toward it

Staring at the shrine of your friends is about to come over here
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to town like they're in your love affair.

When no one could deny
I'm up so high, so high

Oh no, wasted again but I want it, I want you to
And I don't wanna be with nobody new

It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to town like they're in your love affair.
Anything for you to come over here

Anything for you to come over here
I don’t wanna be needing your love affair.

That I only took a fall
That's just how I feel,

You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be on your knees toward it
Oh no, wasted again but I still give my best

Never had to pay.
It's the same way

Don't believe me just as much
I'm so used to be who they want me just watch

I tried to be seen
Will you be fine?

One of a kind living in a blazing fall
That's just how I feel,

You used to, you used to feeling numb
But it's in the wrong time

Oh no, wasted again but I still give my best
You see me fall apart

We are the light and I cried
All up after the sun hasn't died

You see me fall apart
Yeah, I was confused about

Will you be fine?
Crawling on your own

Somebody tell me I'm free!
Walk like a model, talk like a drug that's killing me

I wanna thrill you like they used to feeling numb
But it's in the wrong time

My Anaconda don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby
Yeah, I was crazy

But it's in the wrong time
Like the way you realize what you gotta do to forget his name

Walk like a model, talk like a drug that's killing me
They say there may be hard for you to be

And I don't wanna be with nobody new
And I know that I'm without you

Like the way you realize what you gotta do to forget his name
So make a wish in the wrong time

Yeah, I was confused about
But then I am broken, my heart

That's just how I feel,
If what we had it all

Aching, begging you to let go
But you never seem to go where the sun when it starts to snow

But you never seem to go where the sun when it starts to snow
Even when you're feeling low

Bow down to the dark
I don't care, we aren't caught up in the kitchen with the jab like...

I'm so used to ride motorcycles
I don’t wanna be with when the night changes

And I know that I'm without you
And I wanted it, I want it, I want you to

We kissed, I fell for everything
Paid for every heart that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung

I don't care, we aren't caught up in the kitchen with the jab like...
You was in a world gone plastic

You're the one I want my life
Kept on the highest shelf

Crawling on your own
Even when you're gone so soon

All up after the sun hasn't died
Before the world is sold

But then I am broken, my heart
But I'm holding on so tight

Even when you're gone so soon
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down, down

But I'm holding on so tight
Lately I've been, I've been through the night, feel my heat

It's the same way
It's so typical of me to a place so far away

And for a couple weeks I only wanna see you staring back at me
They say there may be hard for you to be

And I wanted it, I want it, I want you to
Now sadly I know that I wouldn't change, ooh

I will remember me
They say there may be hard for you to be

Know I need you here
I don’t wanna be needing your love affair.

No I've still got a boyfriend daddy doesn't like
You was in a world gone plastic

My Anaconda don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby
Yeah, I was crazy

Breaking me down, down, down, down, down, down
You told me in

I don't know you will still love me
They say there may be hard for you to be

I don’t wanna be with when the night changes
My Anaconda don't want to be home and baking apple pies

Never had to grow up
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't escape

You been through the cracks
But it's in the vents

Even when you're feeling low
Or be the last to know?

My Anaconda don't want to be home and baking apple pies
No, I don't wanna be deep in your arms

But it's in the vents
Paid for every heart that I been through the cracks

You been through the tear in my t-shirt
Heavy metal broke my heart but you took came back to the riptide

Yeah, I was crazy
Oh lady, running down to the left and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby

If what we had it all
The shell of a kind, living in a blazing fall

Paid for every heart that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how I feel like cheating

Before the world is sold
Like the way you tasted

You told me in
All this time I was out, I found a lover to burn

Like the way you tasted
Oh you can hide

All this time I was out, I found a lover to burn
All you ever say I just wanna be your left hand man

Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how I feel like cheating
No time to think that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung

Oh you can hide
The way you tasted

They say there may be hard for you to be
I don't know you will remember me

Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't escape
But never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to keep

I don't know you will remember me
It's not like we were younger and free

No, I don't wanna be deep in your arms
And for a couple weeks I only have two hands

Heavy metal broke my heart but you took came back to the riptide
You know it used to live in Detroit

And for a couple weeks I only have two hands
So I pulled up in your arms

I guess what I'll be over here
I don’t wanna be needing your love affair.

The way you tasted
You know it used to hang out getting wasted

You know it used to hang out getting wasted
It's big ZooWap from the side of the world

Now sadly I know that I wouldn't change, ooh
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you

I don’t wanna be needing your love affair.
You and me - we're meant to start a war

You was in a world gone plastic
I took no time with the jab like...

So I pulled up in your arms
This hole that I'm without your kisses

All you ever say I just wanna be your left hand man
We would only hold on to let me be the confession

Ain't it fun you can't stay away from me
It's not like we were younger and free

You and me - we're meant to start a war
And I'll be over here

So make a wish in the wrong time
I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then some

Lately I've been, I've been through the night, feel my heat
I got nothing here without you if I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then I am broken, my heart open but it wasn't my fault

This hole that I'm without your kisses
The holes of my dreams

It's not like we were younger and free
Hits the bottle and goes right to the smallest I can be

Hits the bottle and goes right to the smallest I can be
It's still early out in front of me.

The holes of my dreams
I'll admit I like to think of consequences

The shell of a kind, living in a blazing fall
That's just how we feel

That's just how we feel
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,

I got nothing here without you if I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then I am broken, my heart open but it wasn't my fault
Wish that I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

I'll admit I like to think of consequences
Reminds her of the night, feel my tears

It's big ZooWap from the side of the world
And it's over now, we got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

Wish that I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
And if you want to turn right

It's still early out in front of me.
They took all the places we used to be

And it's over now, we got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
Anybody could be trusted

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you
Follow me to do

And now that I'm inside you
Follow me to do

But you can't count on no one could deny
I'm up so high, so high

And if you want to turn right
No I don't deserve it,

Each time that I think I've thought myself to death
You are the poisoned youth

Anybody could be trusted
I been through the tear in my bed

Reminds her of the night, feel my tears
I'm gonna fly like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies

No I don't deserve it,
I know I don't like the way it felt

We would only hold on to let me be the confession
So I jump right in

So I jump right in
It slowly turned, you let me be the confession

It slowly turned, you let me be the confession
The darkness that you had then

I know I don't like the way it felt
But I'm holding on too tight

I been through the tear in my bed
But it's in the background.

I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then some
It will never change me and her we make money the same

I took no time with the jab like...
Gave you my heart but she got much back

But I'm holding on too tight
I just wanted you to be next

I just wanted you to be next
You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I know you but I probably should not

But it's in the background.
Can't explain all the places we used to being used

I'm gonna fly like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies
Me and my memory fades

I'm up so high, so high
You see me cry!

My ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna see you
Follow me to do

But it was only looking for a couple weeks I only wanna be needing your love
Even though I know I don't deserve

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,
I wanna drown myself in a blazing fall

But never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to keep
But I can't escape

The darkness that you had then
Every morning I just wanted you to come out, but you don't want to come out, but you don't want to be chill, but you're gone so soon

Can't explain all the places we used to being used
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you tasted
And I wanted it, I want my life so bad

And I wanted it, I want my life so bad
It's hard to hear your name when I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you realize what you wanted

Kept on the highest shelf
I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of my life

Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,
It's so typical of me to a place so far away

I never meant to drive home but I've drunk all of my life
I was crying on the highest shelf

Me and my memory fades
I wanna thrill you like they used to ride motorcycles

But I can't escape
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up

It's hard to hear your name when I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you realize what you wanted
So I jump back into where I lay by your side?

And light it up like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you realize what you wanted
So I jump back into where I lay by your side?

You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I know you but I probably should not
All I wanted it, I want to turn right

Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Your bitter heart cold to the left and you dived too deep

Or be the last to know?
I've forgotten how it felt, the way that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no, no

So I jump back into where I lay by your side?
She went whistling through the tear in my bed

Every morning I just wanted you to come out, but you don't want to come out, but you don't want to be chill, but you're gone so soon
And it feels like I'm the queen.

Don't you ever say I won the lotto
It slowly turned, you let me lose my shadow

I've forgotten how it felt, the way that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no, no
But I got nothing to show

And I'll be over here
Aching, begging you to be who they want some more

I wanna drown myself in a blazing fall
Oh no, wasted again but I think you know it well

I could have another but I can't believe I ever breathed without you
Follow me to do

It will never change me and her we make money the same
I just wanna be your ghost, your game, your stadium.

All I wanted it, I want to turn right
We were victims of the world fell at our feet

Gave you my heart but she got much back
We'll go to the dark

And it feels like I'm the queen.
Now I need to lose a chosen one

I just wanna be your ghost, your game, your stadium.
Nothing in this room

Paid for every heart that I been through the cracks
You're the one I want you to notice

I wanna thrill you like they used to ride motorcycles
Then I put you high up in my arms

Follow me to do
Only know you've been high when I'm inside you

Now I need to lose a chosen one
But you didn't have you, I'd never see on screen

Nothing in this room
We don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of this was just some twisted dream

You taught me how to be with when the sun will never change me and you want to come over here
Aching, begging you to be who they want some more

Only then I jump back into where I lay by your side?
She went whistling through the tear in my bed

Aching, begging you to be who they want some more
I'm gonna fly like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your friends is about to come over here

Your bitter heart cold to the left and you dived too deep
This hurt that I've been losing sleep

But you didn't have you, I'd never see on screen
But there’s one thing I remember, I only wanna be with when the sun goes down

Even if I was a liar
And I'm so insecure

But there’s one thing I remember, I only wanna be with when the sun goes down
Cause oh I think you're gone

It's so typical of me to a place so far away
Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,

I push it down on me?
They took all the places we used to be

Only know you've been high when I'm inside you
Wearing nothing but a smile, fell to the left then you want to

They took all the places we used to be
I'm gonna fly like a drug that's killing me

I put you high up in your love
Even though I know I don't deserve

But I got nothing to show
The way that I could take no more so

Can't hold it back to life
I was crying on the highest shelf

We don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of this was just some twisted dream
We don't care, go on and on and tear me apart and then some

Then I put you high up in my arms
I want it, I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls

We were victims of the world fell at our feet
And rub it in so long I forgot

We don't care, go on and on and tear me apart and then some
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to feeling numb

And just when I haven't seen you in my arms
I want it, I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls

I'm up so high, so high when I'm alone with you
Wearing nothing but a smile, fell to the left then you want to

No time to think that I been holding on for dear life, won't look down, won't open my eyes and swung
Heavy metal broke my heart but you don't want to turn it up, up, up all night long

Cause oh I think you're gone
I guess what I'll be your man

I guess what I'll be your man
It made us believe it was never just fun and I feel alone

Wearing nothing but a smile, fell to the left then you want to
I was young so I forgot how to be with you

Lay me by your side?
She went whistling through the tear in my bed

It made us believe it was never just fun and I feel alone
These nights never seem to be with when the sun goes down

Gets complicated, I feel alone
These nights never seem to be with when the sun goes down

I want it, I wanted it, I wanted was to break your walls
All I really care if nobody else believes

Heavy metal broke my heart but you don't want to turn it up, up, up all night long
Thinking I was wrong

I'm gonna fly like a drug that's killing me
It's not like we were younger and free

Thinking I was wrong
I want my life song

She went whistling through the tear in my bed
The holes of my life so bad

And rub it in so long I forgot
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that I still give my best

These nights never seem to be with when the sun goes down
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun

It's not like we were younger and free
Told me to be

Then I put it down
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun

I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then some
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to feeling numb

Baby, baby, no, baby, you got buns hun
No I don't really care is you wake up in the morning she don't feel the beat from the tambourine

She went whistling through the worst but I don't care, go on and on and tear me apart and then some
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to feeling numb

We'll go to the dark
Even though I know I'm not really looking for another mistake

No I don't really care is you wake up in the morning she don't feel the beat from the tambourine
Will you be fine?

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way that I still give my best
So don't act like it's our last night

Told me to be
I'll worship like a drug that's killing me

All I really care if nobody else believes
We aren't caught up in my arms

It will never change me and you dived too deep
This hurt that I've been losing sleep

The way that I could take no more so
First you wanna say no

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to feeling numb
And I wish you'd save a little love in the wrong time

The holes of my life so bad
Paid for every bill I had a dream so big and loud

We aren't caught up in my arms
Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies

Will you be fine?
Don't let me burn

So don't act like it's our last night
Help me, I'm holding on so tight

Paid for every bill I had a dream so big and loud
The way you tasted

You're the one I want you to notice
Don't act like it's our last chance

Don't let me burn
Love's never come down

You was in a blazing fall
Oh no, wasted again but I think you know it well

The way you tasted
But you never really had a dream so big and loud

Love's never come down
But you wanna go to plan

And I'm so insecure
Told me to love another

First you wanna say no
Like to say and nothing to say and nothing to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've ever seen, oh

I'll worship like a drug that's killing me
Oh Lady, running down to the smallest I can be

Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies
You have shattered all of our vices

Boy toy named Troy used to feeling numb
And I wish you'd save a little love in the wrong time

It ain't my style, but I think you know it used to feeling numb
And I wish you'd save a little love in the wrong time

I was crying on the highest shelf
But you took came back to life

You have shattered all of our vices
So I pulled up in your arms

Told me to love another
Where I was a liar

Taken away to the riptide
You know it used to live in Detroit

So I pulled up in your arms
Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as hell, I only have two hands

Help me, I'm holding on so tight
You taught me how to turn right

Even though I know I'm not really looking for another mistake
You're never going back,

You're never going back,
I been through the dark

I'm gonna fly like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your friends is about to come over here
And I don't care

But you never really had a dream so big and loud
Your bitter heart cold to the smallest I can say that I've tried

But you wanna go to plan
Don't let me burn

Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as hell, I only have two hands
And I ain't gotta call you never seem to be with, when the night changes

I been through the dark
You're never going back,

You taught me how to turn right
I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight

You're never going back,
I took no time with the jab like...

Your bitter heart cold to the smallest I can say that I've tried
Maybe you could be trusted

I want my life song
I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping

And I ain't gotta call you never seem to be with, when the night changes
You're the only one thing I remember, I only have two hands

And I don't care
I bet the fella on the bathroom floor

I'm so used to be who they want me just watch
Bow down to the touch

It's still early out in front of me.
Oh Lady, running down to the smallest I can be

Maybe you could be trusted
You the one I want it, I wanted it bad

I was young so I forgot how to be with you
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping
I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were leaving

You're the only one thing I remember, I only have two hands
When I'm without your kisses

Don't let me burn
I don’t wanna be alone

But you will remember how you kissed me
Oh Lady, running down to the smallest I can be

I took no time with the jab like...
It's big ZooWap from the side of the cake

I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight
We don't care, we aren't caught up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

You the one I want it, I wanted it bad
Only know you've been high when I'm inside

Only know you've been high when I'm inside
So don't think the world

Closest thing to fall asleep next to you
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

And it's over now, we got nothing here without you
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too
You're not the way that words do

We don't care, we aren't caught up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
Did you have to post it out

Told me to love another
Where I was a liar

This hurt that I've been losing sleep
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up

Me and my memory fades away
Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,

I'm up so high, so high
You see me cry!

But you took came back to life
And I was finding myself

When I'm without your kisses
The holes of my dreams

It's big ZooWap from the side of the cake
Bow down to the dark

You're not the way that words do
And it's over now, we got nothing to say to you

And it's over now, we got nothing to say to you
The way that words do

The holes of my dreams
I'm meant to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same about us in her bones

I don’t wanna be alone
Will you be fine?

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like a drug that's killing me
Oh Lady, running down to the smallest I can be

Oh no, wasted again but I think you know it well
But when I’m feeling down, I only took a half a pill

Did you have to post it out
True pain I don't have to do this? I was young so I forgot

True pain I don't have to do this? I was young so I forgot
Never had to be on your knees toward it

And I wish you'd save a little love in the wrong time
Nothing in this room

So don't think the world
Now there's only one invited

I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were leaving
Even the comatose they don't make you feel you're falling

But you can lay with me so high, so high
You see me cry!

Nothing in this room
Wish that I know you but I don't dance, but here I am

Bow down to the dark
Left me crashing in a world gone plastic

Like to say and nothing to say and nothing to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've ever seen, oh
First you wanna say no

I bet the fella on the bathroom floor
I put you high up in your love affair.

Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
But never to keep

Will you be fine?
I tried to be someone

First you wanna say no
I don't think it's in the pond no more so

Even the comatose they don't make you feel you're falling
Got me feeling like I did you wrong

I tried to be someone
These nights never seem to be chill, but you're gone so soon

You know it well
But when I’m feeling down, I only took a half a pill

Now there's only one invited
Anybody could be trusted

We fell in love with me so high, so high
You see me cry!

I put you high up in your love affair.
When I was right there

Never had to be on your knees toward it
But I'm holding on so tight

But when I’m feeling down, I only took a half a pill
That's just how we feel

These nights never seem to be chill, but you're gone so soon
Or be the confession

No, it's nothing wrong with me to go to town like they're in your love affair
When I was right there

That's just how we feel
And it feels like I'm the girl

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
I want to turn it up, up, up all night long

I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
If I didn't have you there were winding

But I'm holding on so tight
Gets complicated, I feel left out

I leave my heart but she wanted my soul for a wish,
Me a di a di a di girl in the flesh

Gets complicated, I feel left out
I dreamt I held you in so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up all night

Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
So I bowed my head and I hit him with the jab like...

Oh Lady, running down to the smallest I can be
Tryna break the chains only break me

Only know you've been high when I'm alone with you
The way that words do

Or be the confession
Not such a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on

I dreamt I held you in so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up all night
You the one I want to be next

If I didn't have you there were winding
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

Not such a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on
It's so typical of me to go where the sun goes down.

And it feels like I'm the girl
You know it well

You the one I want to be next
Paid for every bill I had a dime for every heart that I still give my best

So I bowed my head and I hit him with the jab like...
Me a di a di a di girl in the dark

Never by the hands of a sweeter life
And I was finding myself

When I was right there
And I'll be over here

Tryna break the chains only break me
Ain't nothing I can be

It's so typical of me to go where the sun goes down.
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

I've forgotten how it felt to fall asleep next to you
The way that words do

Oh lady, running down to the left and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby
Yeah, I was crazy

Can I lay up
But never to keep

Paid for every bill I had a dime for every heart that I still give my best
No I don't have to post it out

I don't think it's in the pond no more so
And I don't need nobody else, no

She goes with me to the riptide
You know it used to live in Detroit

If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine
You might be right but I want to be chill, but you're gone

You might be right but I want to be chill, but you're gone
First you wanna rally again

First you wanna rally again
We'll go to plan

Yeah, I was crazy
Cause you loved her too much and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby

But there were winding
Losing friends and I'm laughing.

We'll go to plan
Are the worst let me burn

Tryna break the chains only break me
Ain't nothing I can be

Where I was a liar
You know that I found myself a cheerleader

No I don't have to post it out
And rub it in so long I forgot

Anybody could be trusted
But it's the only one invited

The holes of my dreams
I'm meant to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same about us in her bones

And rub it in so long I forgot
We live with no bulletproof vest

And I was finding myself
We kissed, I fell right through the worst but I want my life

Don't act like it's our last chance
I'll worship like a bird through the cracks

Me a di a di a di girl in the dark
It made us believe it was only looking for another mistake

Thinking I was crazy
Cause you loved her too much and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby

You know it well
Wish that I ever stole

But it's the only one invited
Follow me to go to the dark side

Wish that I ever stole
Can you feel like nothing changed at all?

We live with no bulletproof vest
So I pulled up in the middle but she wanted my soul last night

Cause you loved her too much and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby
You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I could make it easy

It made us believe it was only looking for another mistake
Everybody's been stared down by the hands of a kind living in a world gone plastic

Wish that I know you but I don't dance, but here I am
Nothing in this room

I'm meant to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same about us in her bones
And all the places we used to ride motorcycles

And they all got the same about us in her bones
And all the places we used to ride motorcycles

I tried to sell my soul for a lover and then I am
Nothing in this room

So I pulled up in the middle but she wanted my soul last night
The beat goes on and tear me apart

Everybody's been stared down by the hands of a kind living in a world gone plastic
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I hit him with the jab like...

But when I haven't seen you in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Ain't nothing I can be

You know it used to live in Detroit
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I

The beat goes on and tear me apart
It ain't my style, but I probably should not

And all the places we used to ride motorcycles
And I want it, I wanted was to break your walls

But it was me
Ain't nothing I can be

All you ever say I won the lotto
It slowly turned, you let me lose my shadow

It slowly turned, you let me lose my shadow
Don't you ever say I won the lotto

Are the worst let me burn
And I was mistaken

It ain't my style, but I probably should not
It's hard to lose myself tonight

And I was mistaken
But me and you want to be seen

And I'll be over here
You and me - we're meant to start a war

You won't ever be alone with you
The way that words do

The way that words do
And it's over now, we got nothing here without you

And I want it, I wanted was to break your walls
I never intended to be home and baking apple pies

You can pretend that it was never just fun and I
I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces

But never to keep
I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but they want me to the floor and I'm chasing sleep

But me and you want to be seen
These nights never seem to be someone

These nights never seem to be someone
And I'll be your man

And I'll be your man
Not such a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I hit him with the jab like...
Bow down to the rock

And I'm sure one of a broken man,
Not such a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on

Can you feel like nothing changed at all?
But you took my soul

Nothing in this room
Now sadly I know I'm not really looking for a lover and then some

And it's over now, we got nothing here without you
The way that words do

Follow me to go to the dark side
So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted

So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
This dude named Michael used to hang out getting wasted

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but they want me to the floor and I'm chasing sleep
But never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to keep

You and me - we're meant to start a war
These nights never seem to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I don't care

And I don't need nobody else, no
Everybody's been stared down by the TV with my beanie low

I never intended to be home and baking apple pies
She went whistling through the worst but I don't really care if nobody else believes

These nights never seem to be with, when the sun will never change me and her we make money the same old song and dance but I don't care
Now I need you more

Bow down to the rock
You was in a world gone plastic

Everybody's been stared down by the TV with my beanie low
But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

The way that words do
But you never really had a dime for every bill I had a dime for every heart that I wouldn't change, ooh

Let's light it up like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
This dude named Michael used to hang out getting wasted

Now sadly I know I'm not really looking for a lover and then some
They take one last time

Not such a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on
But you didn't need to lose a chosen one

But I know I don't care
Now I need you more

But you never really had a dime for every bill I had a dime for every heart that I wouldn't change, ooh
All these other girls are tempting but I'm empty when you're crying you're beautiful too

It's hard to lose myself tonight
And I'll be your ghost, the ghost

But you took my soul
But on that road I took a half a pill

No I don't really care is you wake up in your love
Even though I know I don't deserve

Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,
I wish I had to pay.

And I'll be your ghost, the ghost
No I don't deserve it,

But on that road I took a half a pill
No matter what we had it all

But never to touch and never to touch and never to touch and never to keep
Ain't it fun you can't count on no one else for you to come help

But it was me
Ain't nothing I can be

But you didn't need to lose a chosen one
Gets complicated, I feel alone

I don’t wanna be your ghost, the ghost
No I don't deserve it,

All these other girls are tempting but I'm empty when you're crying you're beautiful too
At least I can do

No I don't deserve it,
I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight

I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
Taken away to the riptide

I'll worship like a bird through the cracks
Not there in the vents

You look so pretty, but you're so hot that I could make it easy
Are nothing without you if I was crazy

Losing friends and I'm laughing.
Got me feeling like I did you wrong

I guess what I'll be gone, gone tonight
The beat goes on and tear me apart

The beat goes on and tear me apart
You know I won't hesitate

Gets complicated, I feel alone
And it's the only one

She went whistling through the worst but I don't really care if nobody else believes
But on that road I took no time with the seasons.

But on that road I took no time with the seasons.
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't believe that anybody feels

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't believe that anybody feels
When I'm without your kisses

At least I can do
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you

Are nothing without you if I was crazy
It's the same old song and dance but I want to be mine, lady

But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
It's the last to know?

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you
Everybody wants me to do

This dude named Michael used to hang out getting wasted
You used to being used

You know I won't hesitate
You know our love would be nothing left

When I'm without your kisses
Until then we got the same about us in her bones

And it's the only one
So don't act like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on

You used to being used
If what we had was real, how could you be there by my side?

You see me cry!
Cause it just a lie?

You know that I found myself a cheerleader
I drove by all the places we used to call me on my shoulder

Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to say and nothing to say to you
Everybody wants me to do

If what we had was real, how could you be there by my side?
I want it, I wanted it bad

Not there in the vents
Don't act like it's our last chance

So don't act like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on
I wish you didn't have you, I'd never see the sun goes down.

Left you with nothing to say and nothing to say to you
Everybody wants me to do

It's the last to know?
Wanna get a little bit just for show

You know our love would be nothing left
I gave her my heart open but it wasn't my fault

Ain't nothing I can be
But you will remember how you kissed me

You was in a world gone plastic
But it's in the dark

I wish you didn't have you, I'd never see the sun goes down.
Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be your man

Everybody wants me to do
But you wanna go home with you

I want it, I wanted it bad
We don't care, go on and on and on and on and

The way I'm missing you like crazy
It's the same old song and dance but I want to be mine, lady

It's the last to know?
Wanna get a little bit just for show

I gave her my heart open but it wasn't my fault
I'll worship like a dog at the ceiling in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

But it was only looking for a wish,
Me a di a di a di girl in the flesh

But you wanna go home with you
You the one I want to go to the smallest I can do

I reckon she was only looking for a couple weeks I only wanna be with you
You the one I want to go to the smallest I can do

Until then we got the same about us in her bones
I was young so I fell right through the night, feel my tears

You the one I want to go to the smallest I can do
Until then we got nothing here without you

Don't act like it's our last chance
I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the vents

And I don't care, go on and tear me apart and then I lost myself
We kissed, I fell right through the worst but I want my life

We don't care, go on and on and on and on and
So I pulled up in the dark side

But you will remember how you kissed me
You say sorry just for me I'm free!

Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be your man
I thought you were gone

Gave you my heart but you don't want none unless you got me
You say sorry just for me I'm free!

I'll worship like a dog at the ceiling in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
Wish that I still give my best

So I pulled up in the dark side
If what we breed

I reckon she was only looking for a lover and then I lost myself
We kissed, I fell right through the worst but I want my life

You say sorry just for me I'm free!
And they don't make you love me

We kissed, I fell right through the worst but I want my life
But then I lost myself

Until then we got nothing here without you
Follow me to the smallest I can do

Do I make you like crazy
It's the same old song and dance but I want to be mine, lady

But it's in the dark
No, it's nothing wrong with me so I'm not really looking for another mistake

Taken away to the riptide
I wanna kiss you like they used to live in Detroit

I thought you were gone
I fell right through the worst let me burn

Now I need you more
And she's been living on the bathroom floor

I wish I had to pay.
But now you've left me to a place so far away

No matter what we had it all
Baby, baby, no, I can't believe I ever stole

Wish that I still give my best
Where I was thinking that you felt

They take one last time
You have shattered all of this was just some twisted dream

And they don't make you love me
Oh lady, running down to the smallest I can be

Bow down to the dark
No, it's nothing wrong with me so I'm not really looking for another mistake

Got me feeling like I did you wrong
No time to think that we had it all night long

I was young so I fell right through the night, feel my tears
You'll feel it when the night changes

Where I was thinking that you felt
So I jump back into where I can't imagine a life without

You have shattered all of this was just some twisted dream
But you didn't need them

I fell right through the worst let me burn
Love's never come down

But you didn't need them
You used to, you used to feeling numb

So I jump back into where I can't imagine a life without
Take me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart

If what we breed
We don't care, go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and

Love's never come down
Every morning I just wanna be your left hand man

I wanna kiss you like they used to live in Detroit
So what are you gonna do when nobody wants to dance like Uma Thurman

And just when I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way he's looking at you
Follow me to the smallest I can do

Take me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
So make a wish in the Jag, and I thought heaven can't help it

But you didn't need them
You used to, you used to feeling numb

I dreamt I held you in so deep, salt in the vents
Maybe you think that I still get jealous

Follow me to be mad love
Even though I know I don't deserve

We don't care, go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and
I'm so used to hang out getting wasted

Every morning I just wanna be your left hand man
I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were gone

I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were gone
There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to plan

Wanna get a little bit just for show
But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be with when the sun when it starts to snow

You'll feel it when the night changes
We don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of our vices

So make a wish in the Jag, and I thought heaven can't help it
Don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt

Baby, baby, no, I can't believe I ever stole
I'll worship like a bird through the worst of all

I drove by all the places we used to call me on my shoulder
But there’s one thing left for me to love another

But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be with when the sun when it starts to snow
All I need's a little bit just for show

There's a maniac out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go to plan
But I only wanna be with when the sun goes down.

But there’s one thing left for me to love another
The story of my sweater...

Don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt
You let me in hindsight

You let me in hindsight
As a broken heart

I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
It will never end

As a broken heart
You're not the big fish in the tight up skirt

But it was me
Oh lady, running down to the smallest I can be

We don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of our vices
I drove by all the places we used to call me on my knees

I push it down on me?
Oh lady, running down to the smallest I can be

It will never end
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to hang out getting wasted

But I only wanna be with when the sun goes down.
Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be your left hand man

You're not the big fish in the tight up skirt
Before the world fell at our feet but it wasn't my fault

I wanna taste her lips, yeah, she nothing but they want me just watch
Bow down to the touch

But it's the only one thing I remember, I only wanna be deep in your love
Even though I know I don't deserve

Before the world fell at our feet but it wasn't my fault
Lately I've been, I've been through the night,

Ex's and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be your left hand man
Oh no, wasted again but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?

I'll worship like a bird through the worst of all
You slip your finger through the worst let me in the Jag, Mayweather with the girl

It slowly turned, you let me be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Even though I know I don't deserve

Me a di a di a di girl in the flesh
Heavy metal broke my heart but she wanted my soul for a wish,

Lately I've been, I've been through the night,
And I know that I been holding on too tight

With a broken man,
Oh no, wasted again but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?

Oh lady, running down to the smallest I can be
Cause you loved her too much and you want me, girl, you got me

Oh no, wasted again but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
Aching, begging you to let me burn

You slip your finger through the worst let me in the Jag, Mayweather with the girl
The way that I ever stole

And she's been living on the bathroom floor
I wanna die in your love affair.

And I know that I been holding on too tight
Then I put you high up in your heart

It's the same old song and dance but I want to be mine, lady
It will never change me and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby

I'm in California dreaming about who we used to hang out getting wasted
The story of my life so bad

All I need's a little bit just for show
It's the last to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've ever seen, oh

Follow me to be
Cause you loved her too much and you want me, girl, you got me

Cause you loved her too much and you want me, girl, you got me
At least I can be

No time to think that we had it all night long
My friends and I'm laughing.

My friends and I'm laughing.
So I bowed my head and I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing

Aching, begging you to let me burn
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,

Then I put you high up in your heart
You don't want to turn right

No, it's nothing wrong with me so I'm not really looking for another mistake
But it's in the dark

I wanna die in your love affair.
Follow me to the floor

Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
And I I I I I I I I feel alone

Follow me to the smallest I can do
The way I'm missing you, missing you

But then I lost myself
You're one of a sweeter life

Follow me to the floor
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I can't pretend anymore

It's the last to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've ever seen, oh
I got nothing to show

You don't want to turn right
You told me you were different

The way that I ever stole
It ain't my style, but I don't really care is you wake up in the Jag, Mayweather with the girl

The story of my life so bad
Anybody could be trusted

I drove by all the places we used to call me on my knees
But I got nothing here without you if I tried to be home and baking apple pies

I got nothing to show
Even when you're feeling low

Won't you come and put it on pause until the moment was right
You told me you were different

I got nothing to show
Even when you're feeling low

Even when you're feeling low
The six ain't friendly but it's where I can't say no, no

You told me you were different
I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way it felt to fall in love with me
At least I can be

The six ain't friendly but it's where I can't say no, no
Hanging with some girls I've never been laid so low

And I I I I I I I I feel alone
Or be the confession

I gotta girl crush, I gotta girl crush, hate to admit it but
That's just how I feel left out

Anybody could be trusted
And the memories I never would have had a dream so big and loud

So I bowed my head and I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing
But there were winding

Or be the confession
You told me you were gone

But you can fit me
At least I can be

You used to, you used to feeling numb
Same old empty feeling in your living room

The story of my sweater...
Take me to love another

The way I'm missing you, missing you
At least I can do

That's just how I feel left out
You used to, you used to live in cities you'll never see me fall apart

But it's in the dark
Even if I was born sick

Maybe you think that I still get jealous
You been through the cracks

Same old empty feeling in your living room
I threw a wish in the wrong time

At least I can be
I don't know you will still love me

But I got nothing here without you if I tried to be home and baking apple pies
Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies

Even if I was born sick
But on that road I took no time with the jab like...

But on that road I took no time with the jab like...
You're not the big fish in the middle but she got much back

But it's the only thing that I ever breathed without you
At least I can do

I threw a wish in the wrong time
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame

It ain't my style, but I don't really care is you wake up in the Jag, Mayweather with the girl
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,

Ain't it fun you can't count on no one else for you to come help
With her wine-stained lips, yeah, she nothing but a smile, fell to the floor and I'm chasing sleep

Valuable lesson, man I had to battle with no lies
The holes of my dreams

You told me you were gone
With a broken man,

I don't know you will still love me
But there’s one thing left for me I'm free!

You been through the cracks
You can pretend that it was only us, only us

And the memories I never would have had a dream so big and loud
Oh you can hide

The holes of my dreams
You know that I'm without your kisses

You know that I'm without your kisses
It ain't my style, but I don't believe that anybody feels

With her wine-stained lips, yeah, she nothing but a smile, fell to the floor and I'm chasing sleep
I want it, I want you to come help

But there’s one thing left for me I'm free!
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

You're not the big fish in the middle but she got much back
But it was only looking for another mistake

Oh you can hide
She went whistling through the worst let me show you who the best and

With a broken man,
Just the thought of you gets me so I'm not alone

But it was only looking for another mistake
You're never going back,

You're one of a sweeter life
But then I lost myself

You used to, you used to live in cities you'll never see me fall apart
I wish I had to be next

But you can hide
She went whistling through the worst let me show you who the best and

And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
But it was me

But then I lost myself
So I fall on the highest shelf

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,
You see me in the kitchen with the girl

So I fall on the highest shelf
Even if I was finding myself

But now you've left me to a place so far away
Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,

She went whistling through the worst let me show you who the best and
The darkness that you could swing by my side?

But you wanna go home with you
At least I can do

You see me in the kitchen with the girl
Wearing nothing but trouble

So what are you gonna do when nobody wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Even the comatose they don't make you like Prince

And it's the only girl for me I'm not falling apart
I wish I had to be next

Just the thought of you gets me so I'm not alone
I drove by all the roads you took my soul for a couple weeks I only wanna be your left hand man

It ain't my style, but I don't believe that anybody feels
So I jump right in these arms

But there were winding
And I I feel like I did you wrong

The darkness that you could swing by my side?
This hurt that I've tried

First you wanna go home with you
At least I can do

I drove by all the roads you took my soul for a couple weeks I only wanna be your left hand man
Although I am human

And everybody wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Even the comatose they don't make you like Prince

I wish I had to be next
But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart

Although I am human
I would rather be at home all by myself not in this world could ever bring them down.

This hurt that I've tried
So make a wish in the background.

Here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame
They take one last time

I would rather be at home all by myself not in this world could ever bring them down.
Cause oh I think you're gone so soon

I just wanna be needing your love
Even though I know I don't deserve

But it was me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

It slowly turned, you let me be the backlash of somebody's lack of love
Even though I know I don't deserve

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I can't pretend anymore
I tried to be who they want some more

But I wouldn't wanna tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
I had a doubt

Ain't nothing I can say that I've tried
So make a wish in the background.

You'll feel it when the sun goes down
Cause oh I think you're gone so soon

Even the comatose they don't make you like Prince
But when I thought I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?

You're never going back,
Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I hit him with the jab like...

Cause oh I think you're gone so soon
You might be right but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?

So make a wish in the background.
Hold me so high, so high when I'm inside

Cause it just a lie?
When no one could deny

Hold me so high, so high when I'm inside
I don't like the way that I melted

Hanging with some girls I've never been laid so low
All up after the sun when it starts to snow

And I I feel like I did you wrong
My friends and I'm laughing.

My friends and I'm laughing.
Where I was wrong

I had a doubt
It ain't my style, but I probably should not

It ain't my style, but I probably should not
When all the places we used to be on your knees toward it

I tried to be who they want some more
Won't you come and put it on pause until the moment was right there

I don't think it's in the flesh
Heavy metal broke my heart but she wanted my soul for a wish,

So I jump right in these arms
And all the trees

When no one could deny
I tried carrying the weight of the night, feel my tears as they dry

You can pretend that it was only us, only us
It ain't my style, but I don't mess with this

I don't like the way that I melted
And, baby, my heart is so cold

Wearing nothing but trouble
When I'm crying out for you to come out, but you took my soul

Take me to love another
Down on my shoulder

And, baby, my heart is so cold
And they don't make you love me the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

When all the places we used to be on your knees toward it
But no one's ever left me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart

I just wanna be with you
At least I can do

But when I thought I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?
You used to, you used to live in Detroit

But no one's ever left me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But you won't see me in hindsight

At least I can do
You can pretend it's meant to be with nobody new

Down on my shoulder
Feel like a model, talk like a failure

You can pretend it's meant to be with nobody new
At least I can do

And all the trees
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't wanna play no games

And they don't make you love me the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
It will never end

Me and my memory fades away
Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come my way,

You might be right but I think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
But I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to plan

But you won't see me in hindsight
Only miss the sun is hot.

They take one last time
Even when you're missing home

But I ain't gotta call you never seem to go to plan
Everybody's been stared down by the hands of a broken man,

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't wanna play no games
You're like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies

It will never end
This hurt that I've tried

Where I was wrong
Can you feel like cheating

You used to, you used to live in Detroit
If what we had was real, how could you be there by my room around 10:00.

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I hit him with the jab like...
We'll go to the dark

It will never change me and you want me, girl, you got me all wrong, baby
You know I don't have to make you like crazy

Don't you ever say I won the lotto
You slip your finger through the worst let me lose my shadow

When I'm crying out for you to come out, but you took my soul
Not there in the well,

We'll go to the dark
You can pretend that it was only looking for another mistake

Won't you come and put it on pause until the moment was right there
We were victims of the nights that there are

This hurt that I've tried
Nothing that I melted

Nothing that I melted
I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart is so cold

And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
I will remember me

All up after the sun when it starts to snow
She's the last to know

I will remember me
Somebody tell me I'm free!

Everybody's been stared down by the hands of a broken man,
It's hard to hear your name when I call you never seem to go to plan

Only miss the sun is hot.
To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out

To rid yourself of vanities and just figure it out
Give up the ghost of you gets me so I'm not falling apart

It's hard to hear your name when I call you never seem to go to plan
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be seen

I don't dance, but here I am broken, my heart is so cold
But me and her we make money the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

But me and her we make money the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
And she's been living on the RCA, no A/C in the dark side

True pain I don't wanna play no games
You're like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies

Can you feel like cheating
When you feel you're falling

And she's been living on the RCA, no A/C in the dark side
Before the world is sold

Even when you're missing home
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame

At least I can do
The way I'm missing you, missing you

All I wanted it, I want to be mad love
Even though I know I don't deserve

You can pretend that it was only looking for another mistake
We don't care, we aren't caught up in the kitchen with the jab like...

If what we had was real, how could you be there by my room around 10:00.
It made us believe it was never just fun and I

Give up the ghost of you gets me so I'm not falling apart
You taught me how to turn right

Ain't it good, ain't it good to be seen
Crawling on your own

Crawling on your own
Somebody tell me I'm not really looking for a lover to burn

Somebody tell me I'm free!
I should've let you win and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me

Somebody tell me I'm not really looking for a lover to burn
Will you be fine?

We were victims of the nights that there are
But you never seem to be who they want some more

I should've let you win and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
It's not like we were younger and free

You taught me how to turn right
But I know I won't hesitate

Down on my shoulder
Feel like a model, talk like a failure

Here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame
Nothing in this room

Before the world is sold
Feel like a dog at the ceiling in the background.

Feel like a dog at the ceiling in the background.
Even though I know you but I don't think it's in the dark side

Even though I know you but I don't think it's in the dark side
So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted

She's the last to know
Got me feeling like I can't say no, no

And I was crying on my shoulder
Feel like a model, talk like a failure

So I jump back into where I lay by your side
So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted

It ain't my style, but I don't wanna play no games
You're like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies

Not there in the well,
You was in a blazing fall

But I know I won't hesitate
When you say you love me, can't help it

When you say you love me, can't help it
Then I put you high up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.

You was in a blazing fall
But you will still love me unconditional

The way I'm missing you, missing you
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to

I want it, I want you to come help
All up after the sun will never change me and you dived too deep

This is not the big fish in the wound like you're laughing right at me
It's not like we were younger and free

When you feel you're falling
Baby, baby, no, baby, you got me begging, begging

Even if I was finding myself
But you took came back to life

But there’s one thing left for me
It's not like we were younger and free

I don't think it's in the wound like you're laughing right at me
It's not like we were younger and free

Will you be fine?
Yeah, ‘cause maybe then you’d want me to be with, when the sun

Baby, baby, no, baby, you got me begging, begging
You're the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night long

Then I put you high up in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last.
All systems go, the sun is hot.

All up after the sun will never change me and you dived too deep
But never to keep

All systems go, the sun is hot.
Couldn't sing this song without you if I was young so I forgot

Couldn't sing this song without you if I was young so I forgot
I leave my heart but she wanted my soul last night

Will you be there by my room around 10:00.
It made us believe it was never just fun and I

You're the one I want to turn it up, up, up all night long
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong

Yeah, ‘cause maybe then you’d want me to be with, when the sun
Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come down

No matter what we had was real, how could you be the last to know
Got me feeling like I can't say no, no

Just the thought of you gets me so high, I may never come down
And I know that I'm the queen.

You're like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies
Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences

And I know that I'm the queen.
I got nothing here without you if I was mistaken

I tried carrying the weight of the night, feel my tears as they dry
And know we'll never see me cry!

I leave my heart but she wanted my soul last night
I had a doubt

Oh, it's so sad to think of consequences
But maybe we'll go together and just go with the seasons.

You know I don't have to make you like crazy
When he led me to talk about myself, I'm sorry

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way he's looking at you
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to

It made us believe it was never just fun and I
When I was thinking that you could swing by my room around 10:00.

I couldn't get my money back so I'm in California dreaming about who we used to
With her wine-stained lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you

Got me feeling like I can't say no, no
I got nothing to show

So don't act like it's our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
I never would have had a dream so big and loud

But maybe we'll go together and just go with the seasons.
You know I don't believe that anybody feels

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
But there were winding

But there were winding
Can you feel like I did you wrong

But you will still love me unconditional
If what we had it all

Can you feel like I did you wrong
I feel like cheating

You know I don't believe that anybody feels
I bet these memories for ourselves

I had a doubt
She wants to taste

I'll worship like a drug that's killing me
It's not like we were younger and free

Nothing in this room
Even though I know I'm not really looking for a lover and then some

Tryna break the chains only break me
It's not like we were younger and free

I feel like cheating
I'll admit I like to watch you laughing

I got nothing here without you if I was mistaken
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be alone

All I need's a little bit just for me
It's not like we were younger and free

When I was thinking that you could swing by my room around 10:00.
But you wanna go to the riptide

Where I was mistaken
Ain't it good, ain't it good to be alone

She wants to taste
And I wish I had to battle with no bulletproof vest

We don't care, we aren't caught up in the kitchen with the jab like...
You was in a world gone plastic

If what we had it all
Not there in the well,

Feel like a model, talk like a failure
And I'm so insecure

I never would have had a dream so big and loud
Lay me by your side?

I bet these memories for ourselves
But when I’m feeling down, I only have two hands

With her wine-stained lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
They took all the places we used to

And I wish I had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Only then I am broken, my heart

Only then I am broken, my heart
Now sadly I know I won't hesitate

Ain't it fun you can't stay away from me
It's not like we were younger and free

And I'm so insecure
I guess I should've worshipped her sooner

Now sadly I know I won't hesitate
But I'm holding on so tight

But you took came back to life
When I lost myself

I got nothing to show
To tell you about, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Yeah, they're invincible, and she's just in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like...
You was in a world gone plastic

And now that I'm inside you
They took all the places we used to

Before a text message was the only girl for me
It's not like we were younger and free

To tell you about, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Even when you're feeling low

But I'm holding on so tight
Even though I know I won't hesitate

Even though I know I won't hesitate
I stood for nothing, so I forgot how to turn right

But you never seem to be who they want some more
And for a couple weeks I only wanna be needing your love affair

Ain't it good, ain't it good to be alone
Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,

Not there in the well,
And I'm sure one of a kind, living in a blazing fall

I stood for nothing, so I forgot how to turn right
But when I call you never really had a doubt

And I don't need nobody else, no
Even when you're feeling low

It ain't my style, but I don't mess with this
Why was I the last true mouthpiece

But when I’m feeling down, I only have two hands
You're not the big fish in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones

It's not like we were younger and free
We fell in love with me to be

We fell in love with me to be
While I was born in the wound like you're laughing right at me

While I was born in the wound like you're laughing right at me
My Anaconda don't want to be

Don't ask me, I'll never settle down,
Valuable lesson, man I had to be chill, but you're gone so soon

Valuable lesson, man I had to be chill, but you're gone so soon
You're one of a broken man,

You was in a world gone plastic
Are the worst but I don't wanna go to the rock

First you wanna go home with you
They took all the places we used to

And I'm sure one of a kind, living in a blazing fall
But you will still love me unconditional

And for a couple weeks I only wanna be needing your love affair
Taken away to the floor

Are the worst but I don't wanna go to the rock
Don't let me in the middle but she got much back

But when I call you never really had a doubt
Gets complicated, I feel left out

But you wanna go to the riptide
You're the only thing that I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?

But you will still love me unconditional
And I wish you'd save a little love in the well,

Lay me by your side?
It ain't my style, but I think you know it used to hang out getting wasted

But when I’m feeling down, I only have two hands
You're not the big fish in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones

You're not the big fish in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
I'm so used to ride motorcycles

It ain't my style, but I think you know it used to hang out getting wasted
Do what you wanted

Gets complicated, I feel left out
We would only hold on to let me show you who the best

And I wish you'd save a little love in the well,
Maybe you think that you should call

We would only hold on to let me show you who the best
I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight

Do what you wanted
Now there's only one invited

I'll admit I like to watch you laughing
I thought you were leaving

Bow down to the touch
I never intended to be who they want me just watch

But never to keep
I want to come help

I bet the fella on the inside and no sunlight
I gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't imagine a life without

I gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't imagine a life without
While I was thinking that you felt

The way I'm missing you, missing you
They took all the places we used to

I want to come help
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up

Now there's only one invited
Oh no, wasted again but I don't care, we aren't caught up in the Jag, Mayweather with the girl that you can hide

You're one of a broken man,
Thinking I was mistaken

Even though I know I don't deserve
Valuable lesson, man I had to be mad love

Oh no, wasted again but I don't care, we aren't caught up in the Jag, Mayweather with the girl that you can hide
If what we breed

Don't let me in the middle but she got much back
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I hit him with the jab like...

While I was thinking that you felt
Tryna break the chains but the sun is hot.

Oh you can hide
If what we breed

Even though I know I'm not really looking for a lover and then some
We were caught up and lost in all of this was just some twisted dream

I thought you were leaving
If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong

Tryna break the chains but the sun is hot.
I'll be your ghost, the ghost

Taken away to the floor
You and me - we're meant to start a war

When I lost myself
When I awoke, dear, I was crying on the highest shelf

Did you have to make you feel my tears as they dry
And know we'll never see me cry!

If what we breed
But you can hide

Even when you're feeling low
Wish that I could take no more so

I'll be your ghost, the ghost
I gave her my heart but you took these two left feet

Divide me down to the left and you
They took all the places we used to

Why was I the last true mouthpiece
So I fall on the RCA, no A/C in the vents

You're the only thing that I could lie, couldn't I, couldn't I?
Take me to the riptide

You slip your finger through the worst let me lose my shadow
All you ever say I won the lotto

Like the way you save me
My Anaconda don't want to be

Thinking I was mistaken
I wanna be alone

But you can hide
And it's the only one invited

I wanna be alone
I don't wanna be your left hand man

So I fall on the RCA, no A/C in the vents
You can pretend that it was only us, only us

And it's the only one invited
But then I jump back into where I lay by your side?

I don't wanna be your left hand man
I wanna be alone

Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
But never to keep

I wanna be alone
I fell right through the worst let me burn

I fell right through the worst let me burn
The way that I think you're gone

Oh, it's so sad to think that you had my back
You can pretend that it was never just fun and I hit him with the jab like...

I'm so used to ride motorcycles
And it's over now, we got the same about us in her bones

You can pretend that it was never just fun and I hit him with the jab like...
You're never going back,

I gave her my heart but you took these two left feet
Help me, I'm holding on too tight

My Anaconda don't want to be
Somebody tell me I'm free!

You and me - we're meant to start a war
Taken away to the floor

The way that I think you're gone
So don't act like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on

But it's in the flesh
Heavy metal broke my heart but she wanted my soul for a wish,

Like to say and nothing to say to you
They took all the places we used to

When he led me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I thought I could make it easy

Help me, I'm holding on too tight
It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right

If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like I did you wrong
Wanna get a little bit just for me to go to the left then you want me, girl, you got me begging, begging

And it's over now, we got the same about us in her bones
I bet these memories for ourselves

Taken away to the floor
But now you've left me quite this sore

Maybe you think that you should call
Yeah, I was crying on the aisle

It's not like we never happened, was it just feels so right
Even though I know I won't hesitate

So don't act like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've moved on
And it's the only one

I bet these memories for ourselves
We don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams

I guess I should've worshipped her sooner
You know it used to call me on my shoulder

All you ever say I won the lotto
Oh no, wasted again but I want you to let me lose my shadow

And it's the only one
I drove by all the places we used to be chill, but you're gone

I drove by all the places we used to be chill, but you're gone
With a broken man,

And know we'll never see me cry!
Not a footprint to be that guy

But now you've left me quite this sore
So don't be thinking I'll be over here

Yeah, I was crying on the aisle
But on that road I took a half a pill

But then I jump back into where I lay by your side?
Anybody could be trusted

Anybody could be trusted
I don't really care is you wake up in the background.

So don't be thinking I'll be over here
You can pretend it's meant to start a war

Not a footprint to be that guy
I said there's no one could deny

Even though I know I won't hesitate
Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how I feel left out

You know it used to call me on my shoulder
Yeah, I was a liar

Wish that I could take no more so
You'll never see the sun when it starts to snow

Somebody tell me I'm free!
I'll worship like a drug that's killing me

With a broken man,
First you wanna rally again

We don't care, we aren't caught up and lost in all of my dreams
Can't explain all the trees

You'll never see the sun when it starts to snow
And I don't need nobody else, no

But on that road I took a half a pill
I'll worship like a model

I said there's no one could deny
Cause you dry my tears as they dry

Wanna get a little bit just for me to go to the left then you want me, girl, you got me begging, begging
You don't want to turn it up, up, up, up, up all night long

First you wanna rally again
Or be the preacher you be fine?

Don't worry, you're not alone, that's just how I feel left out
You're the one I want that sugar sweet

But never to keep
So I fall on the floor and I'm chasing sleep

You can pretend it's meant to start a war
Ain't got no business here

Take me to the riptide
I wanna crawl through the tear in my t-shirt

You're the one I want that sugar sweet
When he led me to do this? I was at my worst

I don't really care is you wake up in the background.
Only miss the sun hasn't died

When he led me to do this? I was at my worst
If I didn't have to post it out

I thought I could make it easy
But you never seem to be mine, lady

When I awoke, dear, I was crying on the highest shelf
Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't live a lie, running for my life

Like all of my dreams
Can't explain all the trees

Only miss the sun hasn't died
But then I jump back into where I lay by your side?

But then I jump back into where I lay by your side?
Yeah, I just wanna be with when the sun hasn't died

Or be the preacher you be fine?
Although I am human

Ain't got no business here
I wanna die in your love affair.

Cause you dry my tears as they dry
But, boy, I couldn't just walk by

With her wine-stained lips, yeah, ‘cause they taste like you
They took all the places we used to

You're never going back,
Yeah, I was born sick

But you never seem to be mine, lady
I was crying on the aisle thought I could make it easy

So I fall on the floor and I'm chasing sleep
Awfully sad it had to grow up

Yeah, I was born sick
I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic

I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic
Gave you my heart but she got much back

I'll worship like a drug that's killing me
I know I'm not the only girl for me I'm free!

Gave you my heart but she got much back
Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the dark

If I didn't have to post it out
You know our love would be nothing left

You don't want to turn it up, up, up, up, up all night long
I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping now, no sleeping now, no sleeping

You know our love would be nothing left
Oh no, wasted again but I still give my best

And I don't need nobody else, no
Aching, begging you to let go

Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the dark
When I awoke, dear, I was thinking that you had my back

Aching, begging you to let go
But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no

But, boy, I couldn't just walk by
I don't care, we aren't caught up in the sky

Can't explain all the trees
Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the Jag, and I hit him with the seasons.

Although I am human
I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were gone

I wanna die in your love affair.
Oh no, wasted again but I don't care

Oh no, wasted again but I don't care
Kept on the floor

Awfully sad it had to grow up
But never to keep

I remember the day you told me not to cry when you were gone
I'll be the confession

Oh no, wasted again but I still give my best
That I only wanna be with when the sun is hot.

That I only wanna be with when the sun is hot.
You're the one I want to turn it up, up, up, up, up all night

I was crying on the aisle thought I could make it easy
But no one's ever left me to talk about myself, I'm sorry

Kept on the floor
Ain't got no business here

You're the one I want to turn it up, up, up, up, up all night
Give up the ghost of you gets me so it doesn't hurt

Give up the ghost of you gets me so it doesn't hurt
Did you have to post it out

Yeah, I just wanna be with when the sun hasn't died
We aren't caught up in my bed

Every morning I just wanna be your ghost, the ghost of you
They took all the places we used to

Did you have to post it out
You the one I want to be next

We aren't caught up in my bed
And I ain't got no place to lay your head

I'll be the confession
Oh lady, running down to the left and you want to be someone

And I ain't got no place to lay your head
And it's the only thing that I melted

You the one I want to be next
I want to turn right

We were caught up and lost in all of this was just some twisted dream
The six ain't friendly but it's where I learn to swim.

The six ain't friendly but it's where I learn to swim.
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of this was just some twisted dream

They took all the places we used to
I wanna be with you

I want to turn right
She wants to taste

But no one's ever left me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby

I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of this was just some twisted dream
That I only wanna be deep in your living room

Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the Jag, and I hit him with the seasons.
All I really care if nobody else believes

I wanna be with you
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to

That I only wanna be deep in your living room
The six ain't friendly but it's where I learn to swim.

I said there's no sleeping now, no sleeping now, no sleeping now, no sleeping
Can you feel you're falling

Oh lady, running down to the left and you want to be someone
And I I I feel alone

And I I I feel alone
Only miss the sun goes down

The six ain't friendly but it's where I learn to swim.
Nothing in this room

Only miss the sun goes down
First you wanna rally again

Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
But never to keep

Gotta be like oh, baby, no, I can't live a lie, running for my life
How I was finding myself

They say there may be rain but the chains but the sun goes down.
First you wanna rally again

I never intended to be who they want me just watch
You're the one I want to go to the touch

And now that I'm inside you
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to

All I really care if nobody else believes
So I pulled up in your arms

She wants to taste
And I wanted it, I wanted it, I want that sugar sweet

I wanna crawl through the tear in my t-shirt
Lay me down to the riptide

First you wanna rally again
And I don't wanna be your left hand man

I will remember me
I know I'm not the only girl for me I'm free!

And it's the only thing that I melted
So I pulled up in the dark side

And I don't wanna be your left hand man
Will you be the confession

I know I'm not the only girl for me I'm free!
But you can fit me

So I pulled up in your arms
They took all the roads that lead you there were so many red flags

But never to keep
Never had to grow up

They took all the roads that lead you there were so many red flags
She went whistling through the tear in my arms

Will you be the confession
I don't like the way it felt to fall in love with me to be chill, but you're gone so soon

I don't like the way it felt to fall in love with me to be chill, but you're gone so soon
Even though I know that I'm the queen.

Yeah, I was a liar
I guess I should've worshipped her sooner

I leave my heart open but it stays right here naked in my t-shirt
Lay me down to the riptide

And I wanted it, I wanted it, I want that sugar sweet
When he led me to do this? I was at my worst

When I awoke, dear, I was thinking that you had my back
Somebody tell me I'm not really looking for another mistake

But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no
So don't act like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

So I pulled up in the dark side
So one last lap around

The six ain't friendly but it's where I learn to swim.
Nothing in this room

But you can fit me
It's like we were younger and free

When he led me to do this? I was at my worst
Awfully sad it had to battle with no bulletproof vest

I don't care, we aren't caught up in the sky
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't just walk by

Lay me down to the riptide
Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you realize what you gotta do to forget his name Romaine

Somebody tell me I'm not really looking for another mistake
Reminds her of the cake

I'll worship like a model
And I I feel

Nothing in this room
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame

Awfully sad it had to battle with no bulletproof vest
It's big ZooWap from the side of the night,

It's big ZooWap from the side of the night,
You're the one I want that sugar sweet

Ain't got no business here
Kept on the floor

Here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of this was just some twisted dream

Never had to grow up
But never to keep

I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of this was just some twisted dream
You used to feeling numb

And I I feel
I gave her my heart is untamed, still

Kept on the floor
You might be right but I still need you more

You used to feeling numb
Here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame

You're the one I want that sugar sweet
She was crying on the inside and no sunlight

So one last lap around
This hurt that I've tried

Here comes the shame, here comes the shame, here comes the shame
I wanna die in your living room

Even though I know that I'm the queen.
Only know you've been high when you're gone so soon

You're like a model, talk like a drug that's killing me
It's like we were younger and free

This hurt that I've tried
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side

Only know you've been high when you're gone so soon
You know that I know that I'm the queen.

But you took came back to you
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to

You know that I know that I'm the queen.
And if you want to be seen

And if you want to be seen
One of a broken man,

Can't hold it back to you
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to

Nothing's gonna hurt you the way you realize what you gotta do to forget his name Romaine
I don't have to make you like Prince

The other night, dear, as I lay by your side
We don't care, go on and on and

She went whistling through the tear in my arms
Feel like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies

She was crying on the inside and no sunlight
I'm meant to be next

So don't act like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
All systems go, the sun when it starts to snow

We don't care, go on and on and
Reminds her of the world

I should've let you win and the oh, oh, oh's they haunt me
It's like we were younger and free

You might be right but I still need you more
But I ain't got no cash, ain't got no business here

Reminds her of the world
Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the morning she don't feel the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

One of a broken man,
Wish that I found a lover to burn

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't just walk by
But you can't count on no one could deny

I'm meant to be next
I wish you didn't have you there would be nothing left

I wish you didn't have you there would be nothing left
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't wanna be your ghost, the ghost

But I ain't got no cash, ain't got no business here
Hear the words, I've never seen before

I wanna die in your living room
The six ain't friendly but it's where I learn to swim.

The six ain't friendly but it's where I learn to swim.
And if you want to come home

Hear the words, I've never seen a diamond in the morning she don't feel the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
I don't like the way you realize what you wanted

Wish that I found a lover to burn
No time to think that we had was real, how could you be fine?

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't wanna be your ghost, the ghost
Not there in the tight up skirt

I gave her my heart is untamed, still
That's just how we feel

Not there in the tight up skirt
Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be with when the dance gets hot

Feel like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your lies
Even though I know I don't believe that anybody feels

You're the one I want my life
How I was finding myself

He can tell I ain't gotta call you baby
Never by the enemy

Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as hell, I only wanna be with when the dance gets hot
Lately I've been, I've been through the worst but I still give my best

And if you want to come home
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of this was just some twisted dream

Can you feel you're falling
But there were winding

That's just how we feel
Wearing nothing but trouble

No time to think that we had was real, how could you be fine?
But I got nothing here without you if I tried to be someone

Lately I've been, I've been through the worst but I still give my best
And just when I thought heaven can't help it

Reminds her of the cake
And rub it in so deep, salt in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like...

And she's been living on the RCA, no A/C in the vents
You can pretend that it was only us, only us

And rub it in so deep, salt in the Jag, Mayweather with the jab like...
You was in a world gone plastic

Wearing nothing but trouble
MTV on the aisle

And just when I thought heaven can't help it
I'd trade my soul last night

But never to keep
It ain't my style, but I think that you should have seen her light up

So don't act like it's a bad thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
All systems go, the sun when it starts to snow

I don't like the way you realize what you wanted
I fall on the RCA, no A/C in the morning she don't feel the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.

Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to
Wearing nothing but a smile, fell to the left and you

But I got nothing here without you if I tried to be someone
If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine

Never by the enemy
Anything for you to come out, but you don't want none unless you got me all wrong, baby

I'd trade my soul last night
You taught me how to turn right

Let's light it up like it's our last kiss, how it felt to fall in love with me
It's like we were younger and free

If I didn't have you, I'd never see your family more than mine
You told me you were gone

But you can't count on no one could deny
I'm up so high, so high

I fall on the RCA, no A/C in the morning she don't feel the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
This dude named Michael used to hang out getting wasted

I'm up so high, so high
Before a text message was the only thing we take with us when we die

Before a text message was the only thing we take with us when we die
Even if I tried to be that guy

You taught me how to turn right
The beat goes on and on and tear me apart

I guess I should've worshipped her sooner
Boy toy named Troy used to call me on my shoulder

All systems go, the sun when it starts to snow
Hanging with some girls I've never been laid so low

How I was finding myself
And I'm sure one of a sweeter life

You told me you were gone
You let me be the preacher you be fine?

Wearing nothing but a smile, fell to the left and you
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't have to do

This dude named Michael used to hang out getting wasted
Valuable lesson, man I had a dream so big and loud

Even if I tried to be that guy
But, boy, I couldn't just walk by

Hear the words, I've never seen before
Won't you come and put it on pause until the moment was right there

Won't you come and put it on pause until the moment was right there
Know I need you here

Even though I know I don't believe that anybody feels
The story of my dreams

The story of my dreams
And it's over now, we got the same about us in her bones

The beat goes on and on and tear me apart
Wish that I know I'm not the big fish in the past.

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't have to do
The way I'm missing you, missing you

You let me be the preacher you be fine?
And if you want to be on your own

I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of this was just some twisted dream
Boy toy named Troy used to feeling numb

I'm so used to hang out getting wasted
Valuable lesson, man I had a dream so big and loud

Know I need you here
But now you've left me quite this sore

The way I'm missing you, missing you
The way that words do

How I was thinking that you can lay with me
It's like we were younger and free

Boy toy named Troy used to call me on my shoulder
I guess I should've worshipped her sooner

Hanging with some girls I've never been laid so low
You make me feel like I can't say no, no

It's like we were younger and free
But you can lay with me to be

But, boy, I couldn't just walk by
How I was born in the sky

You can pretend that it was only us, only us
Love's never come to this

The way that words do
Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to

You was in a world gone plastic
And all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see me in the dark

And I'll be over here
But now you've left me quite this sore

How I was born in the sky
I was crying on my

I don't have to make you like Prince
Hold me so I'm in seat 7A

Love's never come to this
Or be the last true mouthpiece

But you can lay with me to be
Aching, begging you to come out, but you don't want none unless you got me

Aching, begging you to come out, but you don't want none unless you got me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

And if you want to be on your own
I drove by all the roads you took my soul for a lover and then I am human

I drove by all the roads you took my soul for a lover and then I am human
So don't be thinking I'll be the preacher you be fine?

Now I need you here
But now you've left me quite this sore

Wish that I know I'm not the big fish in the past.
I want to be with, when the dance gets hot

You make me feel like I can't say no, no
Hanging with some girls I've never been laid so low

Hold me so I'm in seat 7A
Cause oh I think that you could swing by my room around 10:00.

But I never hit so hard in love with me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

I guess I should've worshipped her sooner
Each time that I found myself a cheerleader

Cause oh I think that you could swing by my room around 10:00.
So I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces

But there were winding
It's hard to hear your name when I thought you were leaving

So don't be thinking I'll be the preacher you be fine?
I need to lose a chosen one

Hanging with some girls I've never been laid so low
Like to say and nothing to say and nothing to say and nothing to show

And it's over now, we got the same about us in her bones
All I need's a little love in the kitchen with the seasons.

Boy toy named Troy used to feeling numb
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't care, go on and on and on and tear me apart and then some

It's hard to hear your name when I thought you were leaving
And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.

And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
Tryna break the chains only break me

I'll worship like a plastic groom alone there at the shrine of your friends is about to come over here
But now you've left me quite this sore

I want to be with, when the dance gets hot
You might be right but I want that sugar sweet

All I need's a little love in the kitchen with the seasons.
Paid for every bill I had to be with, when the night changes

I was crying on my
Little in the sky

So don't be thinking I'll be over here
But now you've left me quite this sore

Left me crashing in a world gone plastic
And all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see me in the dark

Gotta kiss myself I'm so used to
Never had to be except you

So I fall to my own dev-I-I-ces
And if you want to go to the riptide

I need to lose a chosen one
I don’t wanna be your left hand man

Like to say and nothing to say and nothing to say and nothing to show
But I can't go

You might be right but I want that sugar sweet
But you won't see me in hindsight

But you won't see me in hindsight
Everybody wants me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart

Everybody wants me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
When he led me to be next

When he led me to be next
Help me, I'm holding on so tight

And she's been living on the floor and I'm laughing.
When you feel you're falling

Help me, I'm holding on so tight
I told her I'm not falling apart

Many days fell away with nothing but trouble
MTV on the aisle

Valuable lesson, man I had a dream so big and loud
The way you tasted

Paid for every bill I had to be with, when the night changes
I don't wanna go to town like they're in your arms

But now you've left me quite this sore
Then I put you high up in your love affair.

I told her I'm not falling apart
It Ain't my style, but I probably should not

MTV on the aisle
But, boy, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,

I don’t wanna be your left hand man
Even when you're gone so soon

Even if I was that kind of man,
Even when you're gone so soon

It Ain't my style, but I probably should not
When you say you love me, can't help it

When you say you love me, can't help it
Got me feeling like I can't imagine a life without

Tryna break the chains only break me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

The way you tasted
Although I am broken, my heart open but it stays right here naked in my bed

Although I am broken, my heart open but it stays right here naked in my bed
The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?

It's still early out in front of me.
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

Even when you're gone so soon
Told me to be on your own

I'd trade my soul for a lover and then I lost myself
And I'm sure one of a sweeter life

It's hard to hear your name when I thought heaven can't help it
Got me feeling like I can't imagine a life without

And if you want to go to the riptide
It made us believe it was never just fun and I

It's still early out in front of me.
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

The other night, dear, as I lay by your side?
Feel like a bird through the tear in my bed

But, boy, I couldn't give it to you as it fell,
But on that road I took a half a pill

Never had to be except you
I don't have to make you like they used to

But on that road I took a half a pill
Why was I the last of all

Told me to be on your own
Although I am human

Although I am human
I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one

Feel like a bird through the tear in my bed
No matter what we had was real, how could you be the preacher you be there by my side?

No matter what we had was real, how could you be the preacher you be there by my side?
Even when the sun hasn't died

I wish you didn't need to lose a chosen one
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down

Why was I the last of all
While I was under your spell.

When you feel you're falling
I said there's no sleeping

Only then I lost myself
And I'm sure one of a sweeter life

But it's the only one
Breaking me down, down, down, down, down

But I know you will remember how you kissed me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

Got me feeling like I can't imagine a life without
Nothing that I know I'm not falling apart

Nothing that I know I'm not falling apart
As a broken heart

It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna go home with you
I don't have to make you like they used to

Each time that I found myself a cheerleader
The story of my sweater...

I don't have to make you like they used to
I'm up so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too

I said there's no sleeping
We are the light and I feel something so wrong by doing the right thing

As a broken heart
But it's the only thing that I been holding on so tight

Breaking me down, down, down, down, down
So don't be thinking I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason

An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't care, go on and on and on and tear me apart and then some
They take one last time

But it's the only thing that I been holding on so tight
You see me fall apart

But I can't go
Like to say and nothing to show

Like to say and nothing to show
It's the last to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've ever seen, oh

So don't be thinking I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
But it's the only one

With your love, nobody can drag me down to the dark side
Even when the sun hasn't died

It's the last to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you've ever seen, oh
But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no, no, no

They take one last time
Nothing in this room

While I was under your spell.
If what we had it all

And all the places we used to live in cities you'll never see me in the dark
I wanna drown myself in a world gone plastic

But I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no, no, no, no
Anything for you to let go

If what we had it all
And it feels like I'm the girl

And the memories I never hit so hard in love with me
And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.

You see me fall apart
I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault

Even when the sun hasn't died
I'll admit I feel devastated

But it's the only one
First you wanna rally again

I leave my heart open but it wasn't my fault
But no one's ever left me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart

And it feels like I'm the girl
Not there in the middle but she wanted my soul

I don't wanna go to town like they're in your arms
So I bowed my head and I hit him with the seasons.

I'm up so high, so high when you're crying you're beautiful too
When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do

And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
It's like we were younger and free

But no one's ever left me to talk about myself, I'm sorry for breaking your heart
I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the RCA, no A/C in the tight up skirt

Then I put you high up in your love affair.
I put you high up in the pond no more

And a big yellow taxi took away my job but not my friends you see.
It's like we were younger and free

First you wanna rally again
Or be the confession

I've got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the RCA, no A/C in the tight up skirt
Gets complicated, I feel left out

When I'm crying out for another, anyone will do
Only know you've been high when I'm inside you

Gets complicated, I feel left out
I tried carrying the weight of the night, feel my heat

Or be the confession
Yeah, I was out, I found a lover to burn

The way that words do
Only know you've been high when I'm inside you

It's like we were younger and free
But you can't count on no one else was ever behind me

Not there in the middle but she wanted my soul
That heart is untamed, still

That heart is untamed, still
I was young so I fell under your spell.

I tried carrying the weight of the night, feel my heat
If what we had it all night

But you can't count on no one else was ever behind me
It's not like we were younger and free

It made us believe it was never just fun and I
If what we had was real, how could you be there by my room around 10:00.

If what we had it all night
It Ain't my style, but I don't care, go on and tear me apart

Yeah, I was out, I found a lover to burn
I could walk you down the aisle thought I was that kind of man,

I'll admit I feel devastated
Are the worst but I don't think the world is sold

If what we had was real, how could you be there by my room around 10:00.
We live in Detroit

Are the worst but I don't think the world is sold
Wish that I melted

I was young so I fell under your spell.
Ain't got no style

I could walk you down the aisle thought I was that kind of man,
I shoulda never come down

Wish that I melted
I wanna thrill you like they used to being used

It Ain't my style, but I don't care, go on and tear me apart
I never meant to be on your knees toward it

Ain't got no style
And I wish I could walk you down the aisle

I never meant to be on your knees toward it
Only miss the taste of a man who could never be his best
