You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for the place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come in to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance...
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave them burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh [x2]
I stretched my hands out to the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
I'm never gonna look back
Whoa, I'm never gonna give it up
No, please don't wake me now
(2, 3, 4)
Oo-o-o-o-oo
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-ife
I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
But all the possibilities
No limits just epiphanies
No, just don't wake me now
I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (control)
Oo-o-o-o-o
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gotta be
The best day of my life
Everything is looking up, everybody up now
If you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
You were better, deeper
I was under your spell
Like a deadly fever, yeah, babe
On the highway to hell, yeah
No more, baby, ooh
Thought on your body
I came alive
It was lethal
It was fatal
In my dreams it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Oh, baby
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)
Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world
(Ah, my my, what elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Oh, my my, what a sensation)
(Oh, my my, what elation)
(Oh, my my, what)
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations) (Oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations
Na na na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Do do do do do, do do do (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
When you worry you make it double
Ooh, ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
(Don't worry)
Ooh oo-ooh ooh ooh oo-ooh
(Be happy)
Ooh oo-ooh oo-ooh
(Don't worry, be happy)
Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
The land lord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
(Look at me I'm happy)
(Be Happy)
Here I give you my phone number
When you worry call me, I make you happy
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now
Now there, is this song I wrote
I hope you learned it note for note
Like good little children
Listen to what I say
In your life expect some trouble
Don't worry, be happy, be happy now
(Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it, be happy)
(Put a smile on your face, don't bring everybody down)
I'm not worried, I'm happy
Well, maybe it's the common curse
Maybe things get bad before they get worse
I don't wanna become someone
Who can't live up to what already done
Don't keep it just to figure it out
When it rains and pours, and then it runs out
I was crying on the bathroom floor
And just when I thought I could take no more
Well, here comes a comeback
The kid is back, is back on track
And there goes my hero
He's an underdog, he's coming out on top
And come on, come on back, that's my dog
It was a park of the trailer park
She went whistling through the graveyard
She came to raise the dead
And I was a stain on her unmade bed
I found a lover and then I lost myself
And now I'm nowhere, she's somewhere else
And the boys with the brown, skinny legs
Said you're on and on, she sees but I say
Hey, here comes a comeback
And there goes my hero, he's an underdog
He's coming out on top
And everybody loves a comeback
So come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Everybody loves the underdog
Singing that's my dog, that's my dog
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
That's my dog
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Hey
I've never been laid so low
Never been laid so low, low, low, low
Why was I the last to know?
Hear the words, I've never been laid so low
Don't let me be the last to know
Here comes a comeback
Na, na, na, na, that's my dog
That's my, that's my dog
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.
Uh!
I'm gonna kick my feet up
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't
I'll be lounging on the couch,
Just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man
Oh, yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all!
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Nothing at all
Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X
And she's gonna scream out: 'This is Great' (Oh my God, this is great!)
Yeah
I might mess around, and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait
Haha
No, I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
I threw a wish in the well,
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell,
And now you're in my way
I'd trade my soul for a wish,
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this,
But now you're in my way
Your stare was holdin',
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where do you think you're going, baby?
Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe!
It's hard to look right
At you baby,
And all the other boys,
Try to chase me,
You took your time with the call,
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all,
But still, you're in my way
I beg, and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it,
But it's in my way
Where you think you're going, baby?
Before you came into my life
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
And you should know that
I missed you so, so bad (bad, bad)
Come on baby
Let's do the twist
Take me by my little hand
And go like this
Ee-yah twist
Baby, baby twist
Ooh yeah, just like this
Come on little miss and do the twist
My daddy is sleepin'
And mama ain't around
Yeah, daddy just sleepin'
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty
Till we tear the house down
Come on and twist
Yeah, baby twist
Oooh yeah, just like this
Come on miss and do the twist
Ee-yah
('Round and 'round and 'round and 'round)
Yeah, you should see my little sis
You should see my my litlle Sis
She really knows how to rock
She knows how to twist
Yeah, rock on now
Yeah, twist on down
Twist
('Round and 'round and 'round)
Can't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel
My heart's in overdrive and you're behind the steering wheel
Touching you, touching me
touching you, god you're touching me
I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
Ooh!
I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day
You got me in a spin but everythin' is A.OK!
Ooh! Guitar!
One, two, three, four
Tell me that you love me more
Sleepless long nights
That is what my youth was for
Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
Left you with nothing but they want some more
Oh, you're changing your heart
Oh, You know who you are
Sweetheart bitterheart now I can't tell you apart
Cozy and cold, put the horse before the cart
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Too scared to own up to one little lie
Oh, you know who you are
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then
Oh, who you are
For the teenage boys
They're breaking your heart
Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.
I reckon, it's again my turn
To win some or learn some.
But I won't hesitate
No more, no more.
It cannot wait,
I'm yours.
Well, open up your mind and see like me,
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
So I won't hesitate
I'm sure.
There's no need to complicate.
Our time is short.
This is our fate,
Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
It's what we aim to do.
Our name is our virtue.
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours.
So please don't, please don't, please don't...
'Cause our time is short.
This oh, this oh, this is our fate.
Oh, I'm yours
Oh, oh,
Baby, do you believe, I'm yours?
You best believe, you best believe, I'm yours.
[Live On Earth Single Video version doesn't have this ending contrary to the album version]
The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping 
I dreamt I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
I've always loved you and made you happy
And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique
And a swinging hot SPOT
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They took all the trees
And put them in a tree museum
Then they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go,
Hey, farmer, farmer,
Put away that DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees
Please!
That you don't know what you've got 'til its gone?
Late last night I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
I said
Doh
Doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh
Doh doh doh, doh duh (Aaaaaaow!)
This hit
That ice cold
Michelle Pfeiffer
That white gold
This one for them hood girls
Them good girls
Straight masterpieces
Stylin', wilin
Livin' in up in the city
Got chucks on with Saint Laurent
Gotta kiss myself I'm so pretty
I'm too hot (hot damn)
Call the po-lice and the fireman
Make a dragon wanna retire, man
Say my name you know who I am
And my band 'bout that money
Break it down...
Girls hit your hallelujah (ooh)
'Cause Uptown Funk gon' give it to ya
Saturday night and we in the spot
Don't believe me just watch (Come on)
Doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh (Hah!)
Don't believe me just watch
Hey, hey, hey, oh!
Stop
Wait a minute
Fill my cup put some liquor in it
Take a sip, sign a check
Julio, Get the stretch!
Ride to Harlem, Hollywood, Jackson, Mississippi
If we show up, we gon' show out
Smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy
I'm too hot (hot damn) {hot damn}
Don't believe me just watch (come on)
Before we leave
Let me tell y'all a little something
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up, uh
I said Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up
Come on, dance
Jump on it
If you freaky then own it
Don't brag about it, come show me
Well it's Saturday night and we in the spot
Uptown Funk you up, Uptown Funk you up (say whaa?!)
Uptown Funk you up
Aaaaaaow!
You were a child
Crawling on your knees toward it
Making momma so proud
But your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughing
You pick the insects off plants
No time to think of consequences
Control yourself
Take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanting to be haunted
The water is warm
But it's sending me shivers
A baby is born
Crying out for attention
Memories fade
Like looking through a fogged mirror
Decisions too
Decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot
I guess not
1 2
Here we go
Everybody wants me to be who they want me to be except you
All I wanna do is be with you
They all tell me that there’s something strange
I don’t wanna be with nobody new
Life sounds like
I’m alive [x6]
(This is what it sounds like)
Whoa-oh-oh, I’m alive
How could every day something jumps in the way
Gets complicated, I feel devastated
But when I’m feeling down, I only wanna be with you
I can’t afford the rent or remember checks I sent
To pay off all my taxes and feed the president
But there’s one thing I remember, I only wanna be with you
(Break it down right here now)
You'll be Bonnie, I’ll be your Clyde
Hop into my car and drive like
Fireworks, we will ignite
Through the San Francisco night
Like John and Yoko
Like Ice-T and Coco
Like Jay-Z, Beyonce
Come be my fiance
Hey soul sister, I’ll be your mister
Don’t wanna be no one-night stand
How many things can I say to make you understand
That I only wanna be your man
Whoa-oh-oh
This is what it sounds like
And it sounds like
(Bring it back one more time)
Life sounds like, like, like…
(1, 2, 3)
I wake up in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
They say there may be rain but the sun is hot.
I wish I had some time just to kill today,
And I wish I had a dime for every bill I had to pay.
Some days you lose you win and the water's as high as the times your in.
So I jump back into where I learn to swim.
Try to keep my head above it as best I can.
That's why;
Here I am,
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down
And that's the sound of sunshine coming down...
(Aye, aye, ayeehey...)
I saw my friend Bobby he said, "What's up man?
You gotta little work or a twenty to lend?"
I opened up my hand
He said I'm glad to see, they can take away my job but not my friends you see.
(Here we go)
I want to go where the sun will never end
With my guitar on the beach there with all my friends
The sun so hot and the waves in motion and everything smells like suntan lotion, the ocean, and the girls so sweet
So kick off your shoes and relax your feet
They say that miracles are never ceasin', and every single soul needs a little releasin'
The stereo bumpin' till the sun goes down, and I only want to hear that sound
And now say
You're the one I want to be with, when the sun goes down.
You're the one I want to be with, when the sun goes down
Sing;
You're the one I want to be with when the sun goes down.
You're the one I want to be with when the sun goes
That's the sound of sunshine coming down
(Aye, aye aye, Ha, aye aye)
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Back beat, the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
Realized what you're not to do
Feels the way I do
About you now
And all the roads that lead you there were winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
I said maybe
Flashing lights spin around in circles till we close our eyes
Let the moment take us while we hold on tight
Tomorrow never knows so let's live for tonight
Oh for tonight
Hands up screamin' baby just enjoy the ride [Chorus]
Hey! I found a happy place forever happy days i'm singin' i'm singin ooh ooh ooh
I found a happy place it's written on my face we're singin' we're singin' ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh (x2) we're singin' we're singin' ooh ooh ooh [Verse 2]
let the moment take us while we hold on tight
tomorrow never knows so let's live for tonight
[Lyrics from: https:/lyrics.az/oh-hush/-/happy-place.html]
Hands up screaming baby just enjoy the ride [Chorus]
Hey! I found a happy place forever happy days i'm singin' i'm singin' ooh ooh ooh
I found a happy place it's written on my face we're singin' we're singin' ooh ooh ooh Ooh ooh ooh (x2) we're singin we're singin' ooh ooh ooh [Hook]
I found a happy place forever happy days i'm singin' i'm singin' ooh ooh ooh
I found a happy place it's written on my face we're singin' we're singin' [Chorus]
I found a happy place forever happy days (i'm singin' i'm singin' ooh ooh ooh)
Forever happy days
I found a happy place it's written on my face we're singin' we're singin' ooh ooh ooh (x2) Days (we're singin' we're singin' ooh ooh ooh)
I found a happy place (ooh ooh ooh) we're singin' we're singin'
Days (ooh ooh ooh)
Can you feel it?
Now it's coming back
We can steal it.
If we bridge this gap,
I can see you
Through the curtains of the waterfall.
When I lost it,
Yeah you held my hand,
But I tossed it,
Didn't understand,
You were waiting,
As I dove into the waterfall.
So say Geronimo!
Say Geronimo!
Can you feel my love?
Bombs away,
Bombs away.
Well we rushed it,
Moving way too fast.
That we crushed it,
But it's in the past.
We can make this leap,
So Say Geronimo!
Well I'm just a boy,
With a broken toy,
All lost and coy,
At the curtains of the waterfall.
So it's here I stand,
As a broken man,
But I've found my friend,
Now I'm falling down,
Through the crashing sound.
And you've come around,
And you rushed to me,
And it sets us free.
So I fall to my knees,
Can you feel (Say Geronimo! [x4]) my love?
Bombs away! [x3] (Say Geronimo! [x4])
Can you feel (make this leap [x4]) my love? Make this leap.
Jubilation,
She loves me again,
I fall on the floor and I'm laughing.
Early in the morning, risin' to the street
Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet
Got to find a reason, a reason things went wrong
Got to find a reason why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian, and I can still get high
Well, life is (too short), so love the one you got
'Cause you might get run over or you might get shot
Never start no static I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with no bulletproof vest
Take a small example, take a tip from me
Take all of your money, give it all to charity
Love is what I got
It's within my reach
And the Sublime style's still straight from Long Beach
It all comes back to you, you'll finally get what you deserve
Try and test that you're bound to get served
Love's what I got
Don't start a riot
You'll feel it when the dance gets hot
Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that
Lovin', is what I got, now remember that
Lovin', is what I got
(That's) why I don't cry when my dog runs away
I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay
I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle and goes right to the rock
Livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane
Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me
Lovin', is what I got, I got I got I got
I was young so I forgot
Which was my place and which was not
Thought I had a good shot
I took it right in my eye
Look ahead, look behind
Take another, I don't mind
I, oh, I, oh
Follow the signs right back to you
Back to you, back to you
I know they wind right back to you
Back to you
So, put a posy in your hair
Pretend you couldn't give a care
Whistle past the graveyard
Even the dead deserve a song
Let the moon do what she does
She don't need to make a fuss
She don't know she shines for us
Something tells me that she does
Time after time, I follow signs
Love, lower your eyes
Leave me a sign
I trust the signs so I may find my way to you
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And, darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And, baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me—I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way (mmm...)
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And, baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That, baby, now
Thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are (oh, oh)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, lo-ud
So, baby, now
Oh, darling, place your head on my beating heart
But maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are
You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much
You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me to the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life
So love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do
What are you waiting for?
Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin is a holy grail I've got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Yeah, I'll let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around I can't see clear no more
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (like you do)
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (yeah)
I'll let you set the pace
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do (oh)

I got whatever on my boy, whatever
Put your money where your mouth is
Money on the wood make the game go good
Money outta sight cause fights
Put up or shut up
Uh, Nitt Da Gritt

I'm hurting, baby, I'm broken down
I need your loving, loving
I need it now
When I'm without you
I'm something weak
You got me begging, begging
I'm on my knees
[Pre-Chorus:]
I don't wanna be needing your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killing me when you're away, ooh, baby,
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste
[Chorus:]
Your sugar
Yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving
Make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
My broken pieces
You pick them up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging
Come give me some
When I'm without ya
I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing
I'm living for
I'm right here,
'Cause I need
Your sugar! (sugar!)
Yes, please (yes, please)
I want that red velvet
I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it
Unless that somebody's me
I gotta be your man
There ain't no other way
'Cause girl you're hotter than a southern California day
I don't wanna play no games
You don't gotta be afraid
No make-up on
That's my
Sugar
Yes, please (please)
Won't you come and put it down on me (down on me)?
I'm right here (right here), 'cause I need ('cause I need)
So, baby, (yeah) you show me good loving
Won't you come and put it down on me? (down on me, down on me)
Dis ah no mystery check the history
From you hear my voice it's no secret
Cheerleader song make the world sing along
Now Samantha J pon the remix
Me a di a di girl in the tight up skirt
But Omi call me cheerleader
Pompoms in my hand when I'm singing this song
Omi make me turn up the speaker
Say oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
When I need motivation, my one solution
Is my queen cause she stay strong yeah yeah
She's always in my corner right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting but I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me
Do you think I'm pretty
Do I make you feel like cheating
I'm like no not really (nuh uh)
Cause oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
If it's wrong I don't care I'm a right this
Thinks you do have me flying the highest
Say whatever what you want call me like it
For the haters out there, you can bite this
You gotta know how to
Walk like a model, talk like a model
Call me Ms. Jamaica because I'm a model
Been looking like say I won the lotto
Everywhere I go, got them off there singing like
She is always right there when I need her
She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention
You're the only girl for me
No I don't need no next one
Mama loves you too
She thinks I made the right selection
All that's left to do is just for me to pop the question
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
"Oh don't you dare look back.
Just keep your eyes on me."
I said, "You're holding back,"
She said, "Shut up and dance with me!"
This woman is my destiny
She said, "Ooh-ooh-hoo,
Shut up and dance with me."
We were victims of the night,
The chemical, physical, kryptonite
Oh, we were bound to get together,
Bound to get together.
She took my arm,
I don't know how it happened.
We took the floor and she said,
"Oh, don't you dare look back.
A backless dress and some beat up sneaks,
My discothèque, Juliet teenage dream.
I felt it in my chest as she looked at me.
I knew we were bound to be together,
Bound to be together
Oh, come on girl!
Deep in her eyes,
I think I see the future.
I realize this is my last chance.
Shut up and dance!"
"Don't you dare look back.
Ooh-ooh-hoo, shut up and dance with me [x2]
You make it look like it's magic, oh, yeah
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
I'm so used to being used
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
'Cause, girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause, girl, you earned it,
Shit
Girl, you earned it,
You know our love would be tragic, oh, yeah
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
We live with no lies
You're my favorite kind of night
'Cause, girl, you earned it
On that lonely night
We said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush
It made us believe it was only us, only us
Girl, you earned it
