I'll never settle down,
That's what I always thought
Yeah, I was that kind of man,
Just ask anyone

I don't dance, But here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It Ain't my style, but I don't care
I'd do anything with you anywhere
Guess you got me in the palm of your hand
Cause, I don't dance

Love's never come my way,
I've never been this far
But you took these two left feet
And waltzed away with my heart

No, I don't dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain't my style, but I don't care
I'd do anything with you anywhere
Guess you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don't dance
Ohhh
I don't dance

Ooooh

I don't dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and round in circles
It ain't my style, but I don't care
I'd do anything with you anywhere

I don't dance, but here I am
Spinning you round and around in circles
It ain't my style, but I don't care
I'd do anything with you anywhere
Yah, you got me in the palm of your hand, girl
Cause, I don't dance

Ooh,
No...

Ooooh...
