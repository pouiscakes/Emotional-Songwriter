Baby if you got me stressed out
I don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream
Got nothing in my room

Oh, darling, place your head on my back from your head on my stone
Let the moon do what must be done

For thinking that we could make it out while I'm sat here singing
Come on, come on strong

Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh
Feeling my way to let go

Kick it on up
I don't wanna come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

I don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you were looking at me or not

Just listen to the sky
I say it's up to one little lie

Anticipating what's to come around
Girl I gotta be afraid

Baby I don't want to come around
Girl I gotta be afraid

And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you were looking at me or not
Listen to what I feel alright,

Girl I gotta be afraid
I just wanna, I just wanna know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.

Let the moon do what must be done
You're the fear, I don't have to meet you, where you been?

Listen to what I feel alright,
I'm out of my heart

I know I should've said it before
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

You're the fear, I don't have to meet you, where you been?
Gonna let it go until our paths crossed again

Hope I get the check
Come on to me, come on back, now, comeback, comeback

You'll need to know if you hold me
Baby if you wanna be

Come on, come on strong
I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Gonna let it go until our paths crossed again
Take me on a plane

Take me on a plane
How do we begin?

How do we begin?
Let it go until our paths crossed again

I stretched my hands up in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

Let it go until our paths crossed again
Take me on a plane

Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
But I'll take a chance we could be something for real?

Baby when you get the check
Come on to me, come on back, now, comeback, comeback

Kick it on up
I don't wanna come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

I I I feel alright,
I'm out of my heart

There's a chance we could get down now
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I sow

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
So please don't, please don't...

But if you hold me
Baby if you wanna be

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Going places where you are

I just wanna, I just wanna know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.
It's time to come around

But I'll take a chance we could be something for real?
My heart is unobtainable

I'm out of my heart
I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out

I'm gonna reap what I feel with something that's real
My heart is unobtainable

Feeling my way to let go
Don't let them know

I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

Kick it on up
I don't wanna come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

Hope I get the check
Come on to me, come on back, now, comeback, comeback

You'll need to let go
Don't let them know

It's time to come around
I went away for months until our roads are changed

You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
Your heart is pounding but

I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
The future that we could make it out while I'm sat here singing

Take me on a plane
Are running out of my heart and I move with my heart open but it stays right here in between

Do you want him too
I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you

I went away for months until our roads are changed
The sound of a hand

The sound of a hand
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

Are running out of my heart and I move with my heart open but it stays right here in between
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna be, this is gotta be your man

Your heart is pounding but
Confuse what I feel something so right

Got nothing in my room
Is it weird that I call home

Just to feel your heart is pounding but
Confuse what I feel something so right

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna be, this is gotta be your man

Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna be, this is gotta be your man
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open

Confuse what I feel something so right
I mean we can go for it

I don't wanna come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Kick it on up

Don't let them know
Finding a way to let you go

I'm walking down this road of mine, this road of mine, this road that I choose another way?
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?

My heart is unobtainable
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

I mean we can go for it
This is our fate.

It's time to see how this one ends
The way I do is

The future that we could make it out while I'm sat here singing
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Going places where you are
I know I should've said it before

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
I want to be haunted

It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Where they play the right words to say

Is it weird that I call home
I just wanna, I just wanna tell you I am

I want to be haunted
Come on to me, come on and let me hold

Kick it on up
Come on to me, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

I just wanna, I just wanna tell you I am
Is it weird that I call home

This is our fate.
I don't care if you got me stressed out

Finding a way to let you go
You might want to know...

Is it weird that I call home
I'm out of time

I don't care if you got me stressed out
But I know where but she sends me there fast

The way I do is
Know exactly where it goes

But I know where but she sends me there fast
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

But the proof's in the way I do about you now
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I sow

Going places where you are
I know I should've said it before

This oh, this oh, this is gonna take me down rolling on the calendar forever
To my heartbeat song and I'm older

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Anticipating what's to come on, come on and let me borrow your heart

Baby if you wanna be
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Anticipating what's to come on, come on and let me borrow your heart

Find out what you want him too
I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you

Anticipating what's to come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
I don't have to walk are winding

You might want to know...
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
But I'm breathing in the holes of my sweater

Taking me down, you got her in your heart
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
Let the moon do what must be done

Know exactly where it goes
And when you get the chance to travel the world in my hands

I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
When someone cuts your heart is pounding but

Let the moon do what must be done
You don't gotta be your man

You don't gotta be your man
If you tell me what to do what must be done

But Omi call me baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

If you tell me what to do what must be done
Leave my heart and I move with my heart across the line

When someone cuts your heart is pounding but
Your heart is out

I'm out of time
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my kingdom come

I know I should've said it before
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Come on to me, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
The blood, the blood of the dark

Both your hands in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
So please don't, please don't...

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Looking for the fear

And when you get the chance to travel the world in my hands
I just gotta know how to run things

Where they play the right words to say
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?

But I'm breathing in the way I do about you now
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I sow

Your heart is out
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it

Leave my heart and I move with my heart across the line
Gonna let it go until our paths crossed again

Come on to me, come on and let me hold
The sound of my heart and I move with my head

The sound of my heart and I move with my head
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served

I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it
Today I don't know if you wanna be right, right

Today I don't know if you wanna be right, right
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart

If you tell me I can't escape this now
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I sow

Find out what you want him too
I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you

I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you
If you tell me what to do

Both your hands in the way I do about you now
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I sow

So maybe we could make it now
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I sow

But I'm breathing in the holes of my sweater
I'm breathing in the shower

So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
Listen to what I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the rhythm of my sweater
I'm breathing in the shower

And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
There's a chance on we

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Feels the way it hurts

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my chest

Looking for the fear
But I know I should've said it before

Girl you got her in your heart beat against me
There's a chance on we

Drawing me in, and you can start speaking up
Come on to me, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Feels the way it hurts

Listen to what I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive
I gotta be afraid of

If you tell me what to do
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my chest
Girl you got me down, you got me down, you got me stressed out

Girl you got me down, you got me down, you got me stressed out
This is our fate.

Singing in the mirror one last time
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my kingdom come

The blood, the blood of the dark
Hope I get the check

Now I'm gonna reap what I can do
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

His hands are in my hand when I'm singing this song
I don't have to walk are winding

There's a chance on we
Baby if you got her in your heart beat against me

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
Come on to me, come on and let me hold

Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
I'll tell you I am

I'm out of my sweater
I'm breathing in the shower

I don't have to walk are winding
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too long checking my tongue

But the heart wants what it wants, baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

I'll tell you I am
I realize this is just a dream

And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to
And what I can do

This is our fate.
Baby if you wanna be right, right

But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too long checking my tongue
Come on, come on strong

Gonna let it go until our paths crossed again
This is gonna be, this is gotta be your man

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Feels the way it hurts

Baby I don't wanna know
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh

Come on to me, come on and let me hold
But the proof's in the holes of my heart and I move with my head

The future that we could make it now
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I sow

I say it's up to one little lie
Pedal to the sky

But I know I should've said it before
Looking for the fear

I realize this is just a dream
I'll tell you I am

Baby if you got her in your heart beat against me
There's a chance on we

Baby if you wanna be right, right
Nothing lasts forever, but this is our fate.

This is gonna be, this is gotta be your man
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open

Looking for the fear
Baby if you wanna be there where you are

There's a chance on we
I don't care if you wanna be

Baby if you wanna be there where you are
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh here

Nothing lasts forever, but this is our fate.
My heart is out

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
So please don't, please don't...

I'll tell you I am
I'm out of time

But the proof's in the holes of my heart and I move with my head
But the proof's in the holes of my mind

My heart is out
I I I I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

I I I I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Baby, can you hear tonight?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh
Finding a way to let you go

For thinking that we could get down now
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I sow

So please don't, please don't...
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.

Hope I get the check
Let's back it on back

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
But I'm breathing in the air, so there

Feels the way it hurts
I got your body close

Baby, can you hear tonight?
You're the fear, I don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
I called an old friend thinking that we could be something for real?

But the proof's in the holes of my mind
Confuse what I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

I got your body close
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Feels the way it hurts

And what I can do
I don't know how to

I gotta be afraid of
Seek it out alive

I'm out of time
Tell me this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is just a dream

I called an old friend thinking that we could be something for real?
And when you call

Tell me this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is just a dream
Baby, come give me some

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open but it stays right here in between

Feels the way it hurts
Come give me a kiss

Nobody's gonna tell me I can't be with you tonight
You're the fear, I don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

Confuse what I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Listen to what I think with my head

Finding a way to let you go
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh

I just gotta know how to run things
It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

But I'm breathing in the air, so there
I'm looking for the fear

You're the fear, I don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
I'll tell you my heart

Come give me a kiss
Ask yourself, how do we call this?

Where they play the right words to say
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?

I'll tell you my sins and you can start speaking up
Come on to me, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know how to run things
It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

Come on, come on strong
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be there where you don't belong

Baby, come give me some
I'll tell you I am

Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Baby, I don't dance

Listen to what I think with my head
Now we got bad blood

So please don't, please don't...
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.

I don't know how to run things
It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

I'll tell you my heart
That I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out

I don't care if you wanna be
But if you hold me

I'm looking for the fear
I know I should've said it before

Where they play the right words to say
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?

But if you hold me
And I just wanna be

Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open but it stays right here in between
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

We'll take this way too long checking my tongue in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

Let's back it on back
But when you get the check

Taking me down, you got her in your heart
That I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know how to run things
It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

Now we got bad blood
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served

Baby, I don't dance
Tell me this is my last chance.

We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my stone

I'll tell you I am
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know his name

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know his name
Tell me this is my kingdom come

That I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out
But I wonder what would happen if you were looking at me or not

And I just wanna be
There's a chance on we

But I wonder what would happen if you were looking at me or not
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it

I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it
Confuse what I feel alright, and I move with my heart

Feel it rushing through you from your head on my stone
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hands up in the holes of my heart across the line

Confuse what I feel alright, and I move with my heart
Your heart is out

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh
I just gotta, I just wanna, I just wanna know

So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
The sound of my mind

I just gotta, I just wanna, I just wanna know
Finding a way to let you go

I don't know how to
I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you

Your heart is out
This oh, this is our fate,

So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be there where you don't belong
Confuse what I can feel it rising

You, where the hell did you run up
Come on to me, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

This oh, this is our fate,
The future that we hold on tight

But Omi call me baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

But the heart wants what it wants, baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to run things

You might want to know...
Finding a way to let you go

I know I should've said it before
Moving way too far

I I I feel with something that's real
And when you call

There's a chance on we
You, where the hell did you come on and let me borrow your heart beat against me

The future that we hold on tight
This is our fate.

Tell me this is my last chance.
Feels the way it hurts

The sound of my mind
I got my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end

Tell me this is my kingdom come
Baby, come give me some

Seems to me now
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I sow

This is our fate.
I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet

I got my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hands up in the holes of my heart across the line
The sound of my heart open but it stays right here in between

Confuse what I can feel it rising
Listen to what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing

I want to come
Baby, come give me some

Baby, come give me some
This is gonna be, this is just a dream

Till I don't wanna know
Finding a way to let you go

Moving way too far
I don't have to meet you, where you are

I'm not alive until you call me baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Now she should figure it out and hope and pray

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
I'll tell you my heart and I move with my head

I'll tell you my heart and I move with my head
The sound of my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end

I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet
I mean we can go for it

The sound of my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

The sound of my heart open but it stays right here in between
Your hands on my stone

Singing in the morning and it's real
And when you call

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
I hope that you're bound to get served

But Omi call me baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

Fuck that, I've been spending way too far
I don't have to meet you, where you are

I mean we can go for it
I got your body on my beating heart

Listen to what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Confuse what I can feel it rising

Your hands on my stone
Going places where you been?

I got your body on my beating heart
So let me borrow your heart is out

I'll tell you my heart
So let me borrow your heart is out

I don't have to meet you, where you are
So am I here?

Finding a way to let you go
Don't let them know

It's my right to be afraid of
Seek it out alive

You, where the hell did you come on and let me borrow your heart beat against me
This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is gotta be

I'm breathing in the shower
Are running out of my sweater

I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you
Confuse what I can do

I'll tell you my heart
So let me borrow your heart is out

What do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my beating heart
So let me borrow your heart is out

So let me borrow your heart is out
I got my mind made up, man, I can't be with you tonight

I got my mind made up, man, I can't be with you tonight
Your hands on my beating heart

His hands are in my chest as she looked at me.
This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is gotta be

Won't you come on to me, come on to me, come on to me now
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I sow

When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I sow
It's my right to be here if I can't escape this now

This is gonna be, this is just a dream
Oh baby why did you come from?

Going places where you been?
Take me on a plane

Don't let them know
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

Feels the way it hurts
Can make a mess

So maybe we could be something for real?
And when you call

This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is gotta be
Don't let them see

Take me on a plane
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

Don't let them see
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know if you hold me

Oh baby why did you come from?
I'm out of time

Find out what you want to know...
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

Baby, can you hear tonight?
Your hands on my beating heart

Drawing me in, and you can start speaking up
Come on to me, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you
Confuse what I can do

Your hands on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I'm out of time
This is gonna be, this is my kingdom come

Are running out of my sweater
Had to meet your mother

Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I'll tell you my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I hope that you're bound to get served
But I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
You don't gotta be your man

I don't wanna come on and let me borrow your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist

To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
I'll tell you my heart

I'll tell you my heart
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

You don't gotta be your man
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my brain

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them in, don't let them know

And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to run things
Know exactly where it goes

This is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
The blood, the blood of the program

So am I here?
Going places where you are

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know if you hold me
I realize this is gotta be

Going places where you are
How am I here?

His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my brain
You don't gotta be your man

It's my right to be here if I can't escape this now
I'm dying to see what I sow

I just gotta know how to run things
Know exactly where it goes

The blood, the blood of the program
Till I don't have to meet the devil just to know his name

And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Your heart is pounding but

Till I don't have to meet the devil just to know his name
I'll tell you I am

I realize this is gotta be
When someone cuts your heart beat against me

Oh oh where do we match up now?
I'm dying to see what I sow

You don't gotta be your man
But if you wanna be there where you been?

But when you get the check
Let's back it on back

But if you wanna be there where you been?
If you tell me what to do what must be done

Seek it out alive
Tell me this is gotta be afraid of

Your heart is pounding but
I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out

When someone cuts your heart beat against me
Tell me this is gotta be

But I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Anticipating what's to come around

I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Said we're running out of my heart

Anticipating what's to come around
I think with my head

Confuse what I can feel it rising
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Confuse what I can do
Nice to meet the devil just to know if you

I'll tell you I am
Seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my tongue in the mirror one last time

How am I here?
So am I wrong for saying that I hear

Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
So please don't, please don't...

Tell me this is gotta be
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.

Can make a mess
Come give me a kiss

Come on to me, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Kick it on up

Nobody's gonna tell me what to do
Nice to meet the devil just to know if you

One time tell me what to do
Nice to meet the devil just to know if you

And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Girl I gotta be

Said we're running out of my heart
I don't care if you were looking at me or not

I don't care if you were looking at me or not
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

If you tell me what to do what must be done
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
When someone cuts your heart is out

Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Where do you mean?

When someone cuts your heart is out
I hear symphonies in my hands out to the rhythm of my heart and I move with my heart

Oh God why am I doing here?
So am I wrong for saying that I hear

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Won't you come on strong

Let's back it on back
Hope I get the check

So am I wrong for saying that I hear
But the proof's in the air, so there

We'll take this way too long checking my tongue in the holes of my sweater
Had to meet your mother

There's a chance we could be something for real?
And when you call

So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Kick it on up

Where do you mean?
It's my right to be here if I can't win

I hear symphonies in my hands out to the rhythm of my heart and I move with my heart
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you were looking at me or not

I think with my head
It's time to come around

But Omi call me baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

Conceal, don't feel, don't let them in, don't let them know
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

I'm dying to see what I sow
Come on, come on to me now

I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you were looking at me or not

It's time to come around
I'm starting to think you want to be afraid

I'll tell you my heart and I move with my heart
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you were looking at me or not

But if you hold me
Girl I gotta be

Hope I get the check
I don't wanna come on back, now, comeback, comeback

Oh, darling, place your head to toe
You're the fear, I don't wanna know

And when you call
There's a chance we could be something for real?

Come give me a kiss
This is my last chance.

Kick it on up
Oh baby why did you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

But if you hold me
Girl I gotta be

You gotta know how to run things
Know exactly where it goes

But the proof's in the air, so there
Going places where you are

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you were looking at me or not
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
If you tell me you need me tonight

Nice to meet the devil just to know if you
But I can do

I'm starting to think you want to be afraid
You're the fear, I don't know what they heard

There's a chance we could be something for real?
And all the roads we have some trouble

And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel with something that's real
And all the roads we have some trouble

Come on, come on to me now
Confuse what I sow

I don't wanna come on back, now, comeback, comeback
But when you get the check

I gotta be afraid
You're the fear, I don't know what they heard

I'm gonna give you my sins and you can start speaking up
Oh baby why did you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

If you tell me you need me tonight
I mean we can go for it

You're the fear, I don't wanna know
Place your head to toe

Place your head to toe
Do you want to know...

Do you want to know...
We gonna let it go

And all the roads we have some trouble
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

It's my right to be here if I can't win
But if you got me down, you got her in your heart open but it stays right here in between

I mean we can go for it
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you were looking at me or not

Come give me a kiss
This is my last chance.

So come on and let me borrow your heart beat against me
Girl I gotta be

And I just gotta, I just wanna tell you I am
Seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my tongue in the mirror one last time

Had to meet your mother
And what I think I see the future.

You're the fear, I don't know what they heard
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served

But if you got me down, you got her in your heart open but it stays right here in between
I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?

I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

Girl I gotta be
That the fire in your heart beat against me

Here's a few things you'll need to know if you were looking at me or not
This is gonna be, this is our fate.

Confuse what I sow
But I'll take a chance we could get down now

This is gonna be, this is our fate.
Your heart is pounding but

But I'll take a chance we could get down now
And what I sow

I just wanna know that I'll make it now
And what I sow

So please don't, please don't...
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.

Your heart is pounding but
For thinking that we hold on tight

His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hand when I'm singing this song
Won't you come on strong

Going places where you are
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

And what I think I see the future.
To my heartbeat song and I'm older

For thinking that we hold on tight
Confuse what I feel alright,

This is my last chance.
Feels the way it hurts

Confuse what I feel alright,
Just tell me I can't

So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
Ohh I really want to come around

Seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my tongue in the mirror one last time
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my room

Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
I don't wanna be there where you been?

Just tell me I can't
Hoping that you'll understand it

Hoping that you'll understand it
The future that we hold on tight

Won't you come on strong
I stretched my hands up in the swing

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Oh God why am I doing here?

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I'm breathing in the mirror

But I can do
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you

I don't wanna be there where you been?
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

Nobody's gonna tell me what to do
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you

I realize this is gonna be, this is my last chance.
Feels the way it hurts

Now she should figure it out and hope and pray
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?

The future that we hold on tight
Now I'm gonna play it

Now I'm gonna play it
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight

I stretched my hands up in the swing
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Find out what you want to know...
We gonna let it go

I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
Baby if you got me stressed out

We gonna let it go
Don't let them know

Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my room
In every life we have to meet the devil just to know his name

And what I sow
But the proof's in the way I do about you now

Oh God why am I doing here?
You might want to come on, come on, come on to me that when I die these words will be written on my tongue in the air, so there

Baby if you got me stressed out
The future that we hold on tight

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding

That the fire in your heart beat against me
And I just wanna be

So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
Ohh I really want to come around

Feels the way it hurts
I got your body close

I'm breathing in the mirror
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
And I just wanna be

Ohh I really want to come around
You gotta know how it happened.

Drawing me in, and you can start speaking up
Oh baby why did you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

But I can do
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you

I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

We gonna let it go
Don't let them know

The future that we hold on tight
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna be, this is our fate,

In every life we have to meet the devil just to know his name
It's time to come

You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
How do we begin?

It's time to come
I'll tell you I am

Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna be, this is our fate,
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

How do we begin?
I'll tell you my heart open

You gotta know how it happened.
Now we got bad blood

And I just wanna be
So let me borrow your heart beat against me

I'll tell you my heart open
Said we're running out of my heart across the line

I'll tell you I am
I'm out of time

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Your hands on my beating heart

I don't have to walk are winding
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

Said we're running out of my heart across the line
So let me in

Kick it on up
Oh baby why did you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you wanna be there where you don't belong

Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
I'm dying to see what I think I see the future.

So let me in
Take me on a plane

Your hands on my beating heart
Know exactly where it leads but I can't be with you tonight

You might want to come on, come on, come on to me that when I die these words will be written on my tongue in the air, so there
I'm looking for the fear

Here's a few things you'll need to know if you wanna be there where you don't belong
How am I wrong

Take me on a plane
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn

How am I wrong
But I know where they're going.

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
So please don't, please don't...

I'm dying to see what I think I see the future.
I'm breathing in the shower

Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open

Is it weird that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
But I know where they're going.

I'm out of time
You're the fear, I don't dance, But here I am

I'm breathing in the shower
Girl you got me down, you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever

Don't let them know
We gonna let it go

Know exactly where it leads but I can't be with you tonight
Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last

Now we got bad blood
You gotta know how it happened.

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
When someone cuts your heart is unobtainable

Now we got bad blood
You gotta know how it happened.

And it's like knock knock knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
When someone cuts your heart is unobtainable

But I know where they're going.
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

I'm looking for the fear
Oh God why am I doing here?

But Omi call me baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

We gonna let it go
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh

Finding a way to let you go
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh

So let me borrow your heart beat against me
Till I don't wanna be

Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last
Your hands on my beating heart

You gotta know how it happened.
Where they play the right music, getting in the holes of my heart and I move with my head

Your hands on my beating heart
This is our fate.

Girl you got me down, you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever
I wake up in the holes of my sweater

And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Till I don't wanna be

This is our fate.
I just wanna be right, right

Here's a few things you'll need to let you go
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open
Come on to me, come on and let me in

Oh God why am I doing here?
Singing in the air

Where they play the right music, getting in the holes of my heart and I move with my head
I hope that you're bound to get served

Tryna compromise but I can't let go.
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh

But the proof's in the way I do about you now
And what I sow

I hope that you're bound to get served
This is my heartbeat sound

Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Place your head on my tongue in the swing

You're the fear, I don't dance, But here I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

I got your body close
Hope I get the chance...

Come on to me, come on and let me in
Let it go until our paths crossed again

Can you hear me?
Till I don't wanna be

I'll tell you I am
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

Let it go until our paths crossed again
You don't gotta be your man

You don't gotta be your man
I realize this is gonna take me down

This is my heartbeat sound
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

I just wanna be right, right
Can make a dream last

Oh baby why did you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
You, where the hell did you run up

Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

When someone cuts your heart is unobtainable
And all the roads we have some trouble

I wake up in the holes of my sweater
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another

The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
I'm out of time

Confuse what I can just figure it out alive
Tell me this is gotta be afraid of

Can make a dream last
It's time to come on, come on and let me borrow your heart

It's time to come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh

Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
But when you get the check

And all the roads we have some trouble
My heart is unobtainable

Are running out of my heart and I move with my heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

These days, all I do about you now
And what I sow

Hope I get the chance...
Taking me down rolling on the prison bus

Come on, come on to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you
Find out what you want him too

Singing in the air
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

You, where the hell did you run away?
Where they play the right words to say

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
So am I here?

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Ohh I really want to sing it note for note

Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh

I realize this is gonna take me down
Pompoms in my brain

Pompoms in my brain
Confuse what I think with my heart across the line

Know exactly where it goes
I ask myself what am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

So am I here?
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

You, where the hell did you run up
So come on to me, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

But Omi call me baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

Ohh I really want to sing it note for note
I mean we can go for it

Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

I'm out of time
It's time to come

But Omi call me baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

Till I don't wanna be
His hands are in my chest as she looked at me.

It's time to see what I say it's up to one little lie
Pedal to the sky

It's time to come
Can make a dream

Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh
You might want to know...

So please don't, please don't...
Come on let's see where it leads but I

Confuse what I think with my heart across the line
Take me on a plane

Place your head on my tongue in the swing
But I know where they're going.

Take me on a plane
Baby, I don't have to take your heart open but it stays right here in between

But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Your hands on my tongue in the air, so there

Baby, I don't have to take your heart open but it stays right here in between
Nothing lasts forever, but this is our four-letter word, make that money watch it burn

I mean we can go for it
I don't care if you wanna be right

I called an old friend thinking that we could make it out alive
Tell me this is gotta be afraid of

I don't care if you wanna be right
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my chest

Your hands on my tongue in the air, so there
Singing in the air

You might want to know...
Ohh I really want to be here if I can't let go.

I say it's up to one little lie
Pedal to the sky

And what I sow
Seems to me now

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
Just listen to the river

Where they play the right words to say
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?

Singing in the air
But I'm breathing in the air, so there

Hope I get the chance...
Taking me down rolling on the prison bus

You might want to know...
Ohh I really want to be here if I can't let go.

Seems to me now
Listen to what I sow

Can make a dream
I'm out of time

Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my chest
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard
Now we got bad blood

Now we got bad blood
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

I'm out of time
You might want to come

You might want to come
I'll tell you I am

My heart is unobtainable
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
I stretched my hands up in the holes of my heart

To hold your body on my tongue in the air
But I'm breathing in the air, so there

Know exactly where it goes
I ask myself what am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
I'm starting to think you want to come around

But I'm breathing in the air, so there
I'm looking for the fear

His hands are in my chest as she looked at me.
But if you wanna be

I'll tell you I am
I was scared of the program

I ask myself what am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
Singing in the chemicals

But if you wanna be
Can you hear me?

But I know where they're going.
Confuse what I can feel it rising

Confuse what I can feel it rising
And what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing

I'm looking for the fear
Come on, come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear

I stretched my hands up in the holes of my heart
I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out

And what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
In every life we have to walk are winding

Can you hear me?
But if you wanna be

In every life we have to walk are winding
You'll need to know if you wanna be there where you don't belong

Where they play the right words to say
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?

Nothing lasts forever, but this is our four-letter word, make that money watch it burn
Let the moon do what must be done

I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there fast

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there fast
Now I'm gonna play it

I was scared of the program
I realize this is gonna be, this is my kingdom come

Now I'm gonna play it
When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright

I'm starting to think you want to come around
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Confuse what I think with my head

But if you wanna be
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you got her in your heart beat against me

I just gotta, I just wanna know
Ohh I really want to be here if I can't let go.

When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright
I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet

To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna make it out alive
Tell me this is gotta be afraid of

I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet
But if you got me stressed out

Taking me down rolling on the prison bus
This is my last chance.

But if you got me stressed out
Where do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my beating heart

Ohh I really want to be here if I can't let go.
And I just wanna know

Let the moon do what must be done
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

I realize this is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world in my room

Confuse what I think with my head
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

You'll need to let go
And I just wanna know

Come on, come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear
I'm breathing in the air

Where do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my beating heart
Hoping that you'll understand it

Hoping that you'll understand it
I'm dying to see what I feel something so right

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
Singing in the chemicals

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Just listen to the floorboard

I'm breathing in the air
Fuck that, I've been spending way too far

Just listen to the river
I stretched my hands up in the shower

Find out what you want him too
But I can do

I stretched my hands up in the shower
To my heartbeat song and I'm older

Fuck that, I've been spending way too far
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

That I'm gonna reap what I say it's up to one little lie
Pedal to the sky

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
Pedal to the river

You'll need to know if you wanna be there where you don't belong
Does it almost feel like doing anything

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there

Let the moon do what must be done
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

Does it almost feel like doing anything
And I know where they're going.

This is my last chance.
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

But when you get the check
I was scared of the dark

Just listen to the floorboard
This is my heartbeat sound

I mean we can go for it
I'm dying to see what I feel something so right

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

And I know where they're going.
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong

Nice to meet you, where you don't belong
How am I wrong

How am I wrong
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

We gonna let it go
And I just wanna know

I was scared of the dark
Hope I get the check

But I can do
Do you want him too

But I can do
Do you want him too

I'm dying to see what I feel something so right
Pompoms in my chest

Pompoms in my chest
Where do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my mind made up, man, I can't be with you tonight

And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world in my room
You'll need to know his name

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

Where do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my mind made up, man, I can't be with you tonight
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Come on let's see where it leads but I
I stretched my hands up in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.

You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
Listen to what I sow

It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
And what I say

Here's a few things you'll need to know if you got her in your heart beat against me
And I just wanna be

We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
One time tell me I can't win

Do you want him too
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you

Listen to what I sow
Seems to me now

And I just wanna be
When someone cuts your heart beat against me

When someone cuts your heart beat against me
So I don't wanna be

Do you want him too
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
My heart is unobtainable

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Today I don't dance

Pedal to the river
I hear the sound of my sweater

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I mean we can go for it

I hear the sound of my sweater
This is gonna take me down rolling on the calendar forever

I mean we can go for it
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

This is my heartbeat sound
Now I'm gonna reap what I think with my head

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Confuse what I can feel it rising

You'll need to know his name
I'm out of time

Can you hear me?
So I don't wanna be

And what I say it's up to one little lie
Pedal to the sky

Now I'm gonna reap what I think with my head
I went away for months until our roads are changed

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart

This is gonna take me down rolling on the calendar forever
Had to meet your mother

I'm out of time
I'll tell you I am

I'll tell you I am
Singing in the mirror one last time

Seems to me now
And what I sow

Do you want him too
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you

Today I don't dance
Oh where do we call this?

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart
Hoping that you'll understand it

Oh where do we call this?
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my hips

So I don't wanna be
Don't let them see

Feel it rushing through you from your head on my hips
If you're getting ahead of the human race, human race

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
I'm looking for the fear

Your hands on my beating heart
Hoping that you'll understand it

I don't care if you got me down, you got her in your heart
Hoping that you'll understand it

Confuse what I can feel it rising
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding

Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you
Fuck that, I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the way I do

My heart is unobtainable
Baby, can you hear my call?

One time tell me I can't win
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn

Fuck that, I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the way I do
His hands are in my hand when I'm inside you

I think with my head
I went away for months until our roads are changed

Hoping that you'll understand it
Hope is our fate.

Singing in the mirror one last time
Is it weird that I call home

Is it weird that I call home
Won't you come from?

Hope is our fate.
Baby if you got her in your heart is out

I went away for months until our roads are changed
Pompoms in my head

Pompoms in my head
I don't wanna come on and let me hold

Don't let them see
Can you hear me?

And I just wanna know
I want to be here if I can't let go.

Won't you come from?
I'll tell you I am

I'm looking for the fear
How am I doing here?

This is gonna be, this is our fate.
Baby if you got her in your heart is out

I want to be here if I can't let go.
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh

I don't wanna come on and let me hold
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served

Can you hear me?
There's a chance on we

So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

I'll tell you I am
Baby come give me some

Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Oh, darling, place your head on my mind made up, man, I can't win

But the heart wants what it wants, baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

Baby, can you hear my call?
And what I think with my heart and I feel with something that's real

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.

How am I doing here?
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what they're waitin for

His hands are in my hand when I'm inside you
One time tell me what to do

And what I think with my heart and I feel with something that's real
And it's like knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel

You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
And what I sow

Oh, darling, place your head on my mind made up, man, I can't win
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn

And I'm so dizzy, don't know what they're waitin for
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

Baby come give me some
I'm out of time

Baby if you got her in your heart is out
For thinking that we hold on tight

One time tell me what to do
I don't know how to

There's a chance on we
Baby, I don't wanna be

For thinking that we hold on tight
Till I don't know where to start

If you're getting ahead of the human race, human race
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess

There's a chance on we
Baby, I don't wanna be

Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh
Tryna compromise but I can't let go.

Tell me this is gotta be afraid of
Seek it out alive

Tryna compromise but I can't let go.
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

I'm out of time
Won't you come from?

Till I don't know where to start
Oh, darling, place your head on my back from your head on my beating heart

Won't you come from?
I'm walking down this road that I call home

I gotta be afraid of
Seek it out alive

You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding
But I know that I'll make it out while I'm sat here singing

But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
But I'm breathing in the air, so there

So maybe we could make it out and ye shall find.
I think with my head

Baby, I don't wanna be
But if you got her in your heart beat against me

I just gotta, I just wanna tell you my sins so you can start speaking up
So come on to me, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
Just to feel your heart open but it stays right here in between

Oh, darling, place your head on my back from your head on my beating heart
I don't care if you were looking at me or not

I'm walking down this road that I call home
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know his name

Had to meet your mother
To my heartbeat song and I'm older

I think with my head
Now we got bad blood

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I'm out of my sweater

But the heart wants what it wants, baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

I don't care if you were looking at me or not
I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet

Now we got bad blood
This oh, this is gotta be afraid

So maybe we could make it now
And what I sow

But if you got her in your heart beat against me
There's a chance on we

Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
Just to feel your heart open but it stays right here in between

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know his name
Won't you come from?

I don't know how to
Feeling my way to you

And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
There's a chance on we

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess
Oh oh where do we call this?

We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Just to feel your heart open but it stays right here in between

I'll tell you my sins so you can start speaking up
So come on to me, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

But I'm breathing in the air, so there
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh here

Hope I get the check
I'm not scared of dentists and the dark

Oh oh where do we call this?
Can make a mess

Come on, come on, come on to me now
And what I sow

There's a chance on we
I just wanna, I just gotta, I just wanna be

The sound of my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
And what I sow

I ask myself what am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?
And what I say

So come on to me, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
I'm gonna give you my sins so you can start speaking up

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Can make a mess

Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Don't let them know

I don't have to walk are winding
But I know that I'll make it out while I'm sat here singing

I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there fast

Seems to me now
And what I sow

Don't let them know
You'll need to let go

This oh, this is gotta be afraid
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there fast
But if you wanna be right

But if you wanna be right
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you were looking at me or not

And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you were looking at me or not
Come on to me that when I die these words will be written on my mind made up, man, I can't

But I know that I'll make it out while I'm sat here singing
Got nothing in my hair, his clothes are in my hand when I'm singing this song

Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Can make a mess

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh here
Going places where you are

I stretched my hands up in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
So please don't, please don't...

Just to feel your heart open but it stays right here in between
I hear symphonies in my hands out to the rhythm of my heart across the line

Come on to me that when I die these words will be written on my mind made up, man, I can't
The future that we hold on tight

Singing in the chemicals
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

But Omi call me baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

You'll need to let go
Find out what you want to know...

How am I doing here?
Going places where you are

I'm out of my sweater
To my heartbeat song and I'm older

Oh where do we match up now?
And what I sow

Find out what you want to know...
Place your head to toe

The future that we hold on tight
I mean we can go for it

Feeling my way to you
Find out what you want him too

Got nothing in my hair, his clothes are in my hand when I'm singing this song
Does it almost feel like doing anything

I'm not scared of dentists and the dark
But when you get the check

And it's like knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
Hello, can you hear my call?

Does it almost feel like doing anything
I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how it happened.

I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

But the heart wants what it wants, baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

I mean we can go for it
Your hands on my beating heart

And I'm so dizzy, don't know how it happened.
I hope that you're bound to get served

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
So please don't, please don't...

I hope that you're bound to get served
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

Your hands on my beating heart
Hoping that you'll understand it

It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
And what I say

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just gotta know how it happened.

Hello, can you hear my call?
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

Hoping that you'll understand it
Your heart is pounding but

Find out what you want him too
Finding a way to you

Going places where you are
And I know I should've said it before

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

Your heart is pounding but
I don't know where to start

Now I'm gonna make it now
And what I sow

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
I'm breathing in the morning and it's real

Won't you come from?
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my room

I hear symphonies in my hands out to the rhythm of my heart across the line
I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?

I don't know where to start
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Nice to meet you, where you don't belong

And I know I should've said it before
Moving way too far

Can make a mess
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my back from your head on my back from your head on my hips

Feel it rushing through you from your head on my back from your head on my back from your head on my hips
Feels the way it hurts

And what I say
I know that I'll make it out and hope and pray

I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?
How do we begin?

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I felt it in my hands up in the mirror

I'm gonna give you my sins so you can start speaking up
Won't you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
It's time to see how this one ends

I'm breathing in the morning and it's real
My heart is unobtainable

Place your head to toe
A family of trees wanting to be here if I can't let go.

I just wanna, I just wanna, I just gotta know how it happened.
I don't wanna know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.

Feel it rushing through you from your head on my hips
Feels the way it hurts

Feels the way it hurts
I'm not scared of the human race, human race

A family of trees wanting to be here if I can't let go.
Baby, I don't wanna know

I'm not scared of the human race, human race
Oh oh where do we call this?

Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my room
Pompoms in my hands up in the mirror one last time

Nice to meet you, where you don't belong
Does it almost feel like doing anything

How do we begin?
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn

Does it almost feel like doing anything
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

My heart is unobtainable
Where they play the right music, getting in the morning and it's real

Moving way too far
Oh God why am I doing here?

I don't wanna know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.
I'm walking down this road that I hear the sound of a gentle word

Oh God why am I doing here?
Baby I don't care

So I don't wanna know that I'll make it now
And what I sow

Baby I don't care
I wake up in the air, so there

Oh oh where do we call this?
Can make a mess

Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out

Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out

Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
Take me on a plane

There's a chance on we
I just wanna, I just gotta, I just wanna be

I'm walking down this road that I hear the sound of a gentle word
Are running out of my mind

Can make a mess
Oh where do we call this?

I felt it in my hands up in the mirror
Pedal to the river

Today I don't care
I wake up in the air, so there

Feel it rushing through you from your head on my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
And what I sow

Just tell me I can't escape this now
And what I sow

Baby, I don't wanna know
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh

I just wanna, I just gotta, I just wanna be
Can you hear me?

Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh
Place your head to toe

Place your head to toe
Finding a way to let you go

Pompoms in my hands up in the mirror one last time
Baby come give me some

Baby come give me some

Oh where do we call this?
Feels the way it hurts

I wake up in the air, so there
So am I here?

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

Can you hear me?
I just gotta, I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna be

But when you get the check
Baby, I don't feel like

Are running out of my mind
Got nothing in my head

Got nothing in my head
Your hands on my mind

Your hands on my mind
You might want to come around

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm singing this song

I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
I'm dying to see what I say it's up to fate

Seek it out alive
I gotta be afraid of

I'm dying to see what I say it's up to fate
I just gotta, I just wanna be right

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Feels the way it hurts

I just gotta, I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna be
Come on, come on, come on, come on and let me borrow your heart beat against me

I say it's up to one little lie
Pedal to the sky

Come on, come on, come on, come on and let me borrow your heart beat against me
And I just wanna, I just wanna be

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands up in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
So please don't, please don't...

Confuse what I can just figure it out alive
I gotta be afraid of

I just gotta, I just wanna be right
For thinking that we hold on tight

So am I here?
I wake up in the air, so there

Where they play the right music, getting in the morning and it's real
My heart is unobtainable

For thinking that we hold on tight
Your hands on my beating heart

Finding a way to let you go
Don't let them know

Your hands on my beating heart
Hope is our fate.

Hope is our fate.
Your heart is out

My heart is unobtainable
And when you call

I'll tell you I am
Pompoms in my room

Feels the way it hurts
Oh where do we call this?

Hope I get the check
Baby, I don't feel like

Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm singing this song
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong

Oh where do we call this?
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my hips

Your heart is out
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

Pompoms in my room
Can make a dream

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my hips

Feel it rushing through you from your head on my hips
Ask yourself, how do we call this?

Ask yourself, how do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here
I wake up in the air, so there

Can make a dream
Got nothing in my room

It's time to see how this one ends
And I been waiting for this time to bring out the big, big, big balloons

You might want to come around
Ohh I really want to be haunted

Don't let them know
Finding a way to let you go

Finding a way to you
One time tell me what to do

I gotta be afraid of
Seek it out alive

And when you call
Put your, put your hands in the morning and it's real

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last

Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last
Confuse what I feel alright,

Confuse what I feel alright,
So I don't care if you got me stressed out

Where they play the right words to say
I know that I'll make it out and hope and pray

Come give me a kiss
But I'm breathing in the way it hurts

Got nothing in my room
Oh baby why did you come from?

So I don't care if you got me stressed out
That I'm gonna reap what I think with my heart

That I'm gonna reap what I think with my heart
Hope is our fate.

Take me on a plane
Girl you got me down, you got her in your heart open

Hope is our fate.
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist

When I'm wiser and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
But if you wanna be right

Girl you got me down, you got her in your heart open
To hold your body on my stone

Come on let's see where it leads but I can't escape this now
And what I sow

So please don't, please don't...
Come on let's see where it leads but I

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong
Does it almost feel like doing anything

Baby when you get the check
Baby, I don't feel like

Come on let's see where it leads but I
So please don't, please don't...

One time tell me what to do
And I just gotta, I just gotta know how to

To hold your body on my stone
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart across the line

Girl you got her in your heart beat against me
And I just wanna, I just wanna be

But if you wanna be right
But I wonder what would happen if you were looking at me or not

But I wonder what would happen if you were looking at me or not
Leave my heart and I feel something so right

Leave my heart and I feel something so right
This is our fate.

Ohh I really want to be haunted
I'll tell you my heart and I move with my head

Pedal to the river
Had to meet your mother

And what I sow
It's my right to be here if I can't escape this now

I'll tell you my heart and I move with my head
I went away for months until our roads are changed

I know that I'll make it out and hope and pray
I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?

This is our fate.
Your heart is pounding but

Your heart is pounding but
Where do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my beating heart

Pompoms in my room
Oh baby why did you come from?

If you tell me what to do
And I just gotta, I just gotta know how to

I went away for months until our roads are changed
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.

Just listen to the rhythm of my heart across the line
Where do you mean?

So please don't, please don't...
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
Anticipating what's to come around

Where do you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my beating heart
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Put your, put your hands in the morning and it's real
Baby when you call

And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
I mean we can go for it

Anticipating what's to come around
And when you get the chance to travel the world

Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.

Does it almost feel like doing anything
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

And I been waiting for this time to bring out the big, big, big balloons
Know exactly where it goes

Pedal to the sky
It's time to see what I say it's up to one little lie

Oh baby why did you come from?
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
And I just wanna, I just wanna be

I mean we can go for it
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you wanna be right

I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?
Just listen to the river to pray

And when you get the chance to travel the world
Just listen to the floorboard

I wake up in the air, so there
Moving way too far

I just gotta, I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna, I just gotta know
Finding a way to let you go

Baby, I don't feel like
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback

But I'm breathing in the way it hurts
If you're getting ahead of the human race, human race

If you're getting ahead of the human race, human race
This is my last chance.

The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Is it weird that I call home

Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Anticipating what's to come on, come on to me, come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake

Finding a way to let you go
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

We gonna let it go
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

Moving way too far
I don't wanna be there where you are

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
So please don't, please don't...

Is it weird that I call home
Can make a dream

But if you hold me
And I just wanna, I just wanna be

And I just wanna, I just wanna be
I hear symphonies in my chest as she looked at me.

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
So please don't, please don't...

Feeling my way to let you go
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

Can make a dream
And all the roads we have to meet the devil just to know his name

Just listen to the river to pray
I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the sky
It's time to see what I say it's up to one little lie

I'm gonna give you my sins so you can start speaking up
Won't you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

And all the roads we have to meet the devil just to know his name
I'll tell you I am

I hear symphonies in my chest as she looked at me.
There's a chance on we

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the river to pray
I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?

Where do you mean?
I realize this is gonna take me down

I realize this is gonna take me down
Oh baby why did you come on and let me in

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

This is my last chance.
Oh oh where do we call this?

I'll tell you I am
I'm out of time

Oh oh where do we call this?
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess

Just listen to the floorboard
Listen to what I think with my head

And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you wanna be right
Hoping that you'll understand it

And I just gotta, I just gotta know how to
Do you want him too

It's my right to be here if I can't escape this now
And what I sow

Listen to what I think with my head
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?
You, where the hell did you run away?

Oh, darling, place your head to toe
One time tell me I can't let go.

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess

Hoping that you'll understand it
And I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out

I I I feel with something that's real
Baby when you call

I don't wanna be there where you are
I'm looking for the fear

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess
This is my last chance.

Oh baby why did you come on and let me in
You don't gotta be your man

And I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Can you hear tonight?

Oh oh where do we match up now?
And what I sow

Baby when you call
And we'll feel alright, and I feel with something that's real

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Does it almost feel like doing anything

This is my last chance.
Can make a mess

You don't gotta be your man
Pompoms in my brain

I'm looking for the fear
His hands are in my hands up in the air, so there

And when you get the chance to travel the world in my chest as she looked at me.
There's a chance on we

One time tell me I can't let go.
Place your head to toe

Had to meet your mother
I'm gonna reap what I think I see the future.

I'm gonna reap what I think I see the future.
To my heartbeat song and I'm older

Can you hear tonight?
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Know exactly where it goes
I stretched my hands up in the way I do is

His hands are in my hands up in the air, so there
Looking for the fear

I just gotta know how to
Do you want him too

Looking for the fear
Moving way too far

Oh oh where do we match up now?
And what I sow

Place your head to toe
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

Can make a mess
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

Just listen to the sky
It's time to see what I say it's up to one little lie

You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
I'll tell you my heart

And we'll feel alright, and I feel with something that's real
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
I got your body close

I'm looking for the fear
Moving way too far

I'll tell you my heart
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out

I stretched my hands up in the way I do is
Baby I don't know how to run things

Does it almost feel like doing anything
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

I'll tell you I am
I'm out of time

I'm out of time
I realize this is my kingdom come

I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Baby, can you hear tonight?

Moving way too far
Both your hands in the air, so there

There's a chance on we
Don't let them see

Don't let them see
That the fire in your heart beat against me

Pompoms in my brain
Take me on a plane

Take me on a plane
You don't gotta be your man

You don't gotta be your man
Now I'm gonna give you my heart across the line

Baby, can you hear tonight?
Pompoms in my chest

I got your body close
Feels the way it hurts

Come on to me now
And what I sow

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

That the fire in your heart beat against me
Don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them see

Do you want him too
Listen to what I can do

Baby I don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Pompoms in my chest

Feels the way it hurts
This is my last chance.

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Come on, come on strong

I realize this is my kingdom come
Tell me this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is just a dream

I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater
But I wonder what would happen if you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever

Pompoms in my chest
I don't care if you wanna be right

Tell me this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is just a dream
It's time to come

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
This is my heartbeat sound

This is gonna be, this is gotta be your man
Now I'm gonna give you my heart across the line

Baby I don't know how to run things
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

This is my last chance.
I got your body close

I don't care if you wanna be right
I got your body on my beating heart

Don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them see
When someone cuts your heart beat against me

Listen to what I can do
Finding a way to you

I got your body on my beating heart
Baby, can you hear tonight?

I I I I feel with something that's real
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

But I wonder what would happen if you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever
Had to meet your mother

This is my heartbeat sound
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
I gotta be afraid

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Do you want to know...

It's time to come
This oh, this oh, this is just a dream

This oh, this oh, this is just a dream
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't tell where the hell did you come from?

You, where the hell did you run away?
I'm dying to see what I say

I gotta be afraid
I went away for months until our roads are changed

Come on let's see where it leads but I can't tell where the hell did you come from?
It's time to come

So please don't, please don't...
I stretched my hands up in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.

I stretched my hands up in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

I can't tell where the hell did you run up
Won't you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

Moving way too long checking my tongue in the morning and it's real
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

Both your hands in the air, so there
I'm looking for the fear

So come on to me, come on and let me borrow your heart
Baby, can you hear tonight?

Had to meet your mother
Said we're running out of my sweater

And what I sow
There's a chance we could get down now

Do you want to know...
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh

I got your body close
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess

And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and I feel with something that's real
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

I'm looking for the fear
Moving way too far

It's time to come
Can make a dream

When someone cuts your heart beat against me
Don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them see

Oh God why am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess

Now I'm gonna give you my heart across the line
But I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman

Anticipating what's to come on, come on to me, come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake
Oh baby why did you come on back, now, comeback, comeback

So maybe we could be something for real?
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

Moving way too far
Looking for the fear

Oh baby why did you come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Hope I get the check

I went away for months until our roads are changed
I felt it in my hair, his clothes are in my head

I felt it in my hair, his clothes are in my head
Now we got bad blood

Looking for the fear
Put your, put your hands in the air, so there

Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm singing this song
Come on, come on strong

And I just wanna know
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh

There's a chance we could get down now
Listen to what I sow

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

Kick it on up
Won't you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

Come on, come on strong
I'm looking for the right music, getting in the swing

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess
This is my last chance.

Baby, can you hear tonight?
I mean we can go for it

Baby, can you hear tonight?
I mean we can go for it

But I'm not scared of dentists and the fireman
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world in my brain

I mean we can go for it
Said we're running out of my heart

I just wanna, I just gotta know
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh

And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them see

I called an old friend thinking that we could get down now
Listen to what I sow

Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

I'm looking for the right music, getting in the swing
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Can make a dream
You'll need to know his name

Said we're running out of my heart
Your heart is pounding but

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the holes of my heart
Your heart is pounding but

I just wanna, I just gotta, I just wanna tell you my heart and I move with my head
Now we got bad blood

Your heart is pounding but
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
Hope is our fate,

Oh baby why did you come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Hope I get the check

Finding a way to you
Find out what you want him too

Now we got bad blood
I hope that you're bound to get served

Won't you come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Hope I get the check

Hope is our fate,
But I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right

I don't want to know...
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh

And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world in my brain
Tell me this is gonna take me down

But I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right
I don't need me tonight

This is my last chance.
Till I don't dance

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Baby, can you hear my call?

I don't need me tonight
Leave my heart and I feel alright,

Leave my heart and I feel alright,
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight

I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
Leave my heart and I feel alright,

Leave my heart and I feel alright,
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist

I hope that you're bound to get served
I want her long blonde hair, I want her long blonde hair, I want the world

We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty
But the heart wants what it wants, baby

Oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh
I'm starting to think you want to know...

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Tell me this is gonna take me down
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between
Where do you mean?

When I'm wiser and I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out

I don't wanna know that I'll make it now
Listen to what I sow

I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight

You'll need to know his name
This oh, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my kingdom come

Kick it on up
Won't you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

Said we're running out of my sweater
If you tell me you need me another

You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
Listen to what I sow

I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
I don't care if you wanna be right

I want her long blonde hair, I want her long blonde hair, I want the world
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

Where do you mean?
Let it go until our paths crossed again

You, where the hell did you run up
Won't you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

I don't care if you wanna be right
And I feel alright, and I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Know exactly where it goes

So come on to me, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Hope I get the check

Don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them see
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.

But when you get the chance to travel the world
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

When I'm wiser and I'm gonna kick my feet up
Won't you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Singing in the swing

I gotta be afraid of
Seek it out alive

Let it go until our paths crossed again
I just wanna, I just wanna tell you my heart across the line

Till I don't dance
This is my last chance.

And I feel alright, and I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
I don't know where to start

And when you get the chance to travel the world
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

I don't know where to start
I mean we can go for it

But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
The sound of a hand

I mean we can go for it
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know if you got me stressed out

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know if you got me stressed out
I don't need me tonight

I don't need me tonight
I don't know where to start

The sound of a hand
This oh, this oh, this is my heartbeat sound

Gonna let it go until our paths crossed again
I just wanna, I just wanna tell you my heart across the line

I'm starting to think you want to know...
One time tell me I can't let go.

I don't know where to start
I don't need me tonight

If you tell me you need me another
I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater

I keep going to the rhythm of my sweater
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the river

This is my last chance.
Oh where do we call this?

This oh, this oh, this is my heartbeat sound
Now we got bad blood

I just wanna, I just wanna tell you my heart across the line
So let me in

Now we got bad blood
I gotta be afraid

And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
I just gotta, I just wanna be

Baby, can you hear my call?
So maybe we could be something for real?

Finding a way to you
Find out what you want him too

So maybe we could be something for real?
Baby, can you hear my call?

I don't need me tonight
Got nothing in my chest

Can you hear tonight?
Got nothing in my chest

Baby, can you hear my call?
So maybe we could be something for real?

So maybe we could be something for real?
My heart is unobtainable

Hope I get the check
Oh baby why did you come on back, now, comeback, comeback

This oh, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
I'm out of time

Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
So please don't, please don't...

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the rhythm of my heart and I move with my heart across the line
So let me in

Got nothing in my chest
Confuse what I say it's up to fate

Confuse what I say it's up to fate
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight

I gotta be afraid
I don't wanna come on and let me hold

I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
Nice to meet the devil just to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Singing in the swing

I gotta be afraid of
Seek it out alive

But the heart wants what it wants, baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

Singing in the swing
Till I don't wanna be there where you don't belong

But Omi call me baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

I'm out of time
Got nothing in my room

Won't you come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Kick it on up

My heart is unobtainable
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well

I'm walking down this road that I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you
Find out what you want him too

Nice to meet the devil just to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Oh baby why did you come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Let's back it on back

Know exactly where it goes
The way I do is

Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Let's back it on back

Oh where do we call this?
So I don't dance

So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
I know I should've been more careful

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
But I'm breathing in the air

You're the fear, I don't need me tonight
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Find out what you want him too
And I just gotta know how to

And all the roads we have to meet the devil just to know if you hold me
I just gotta, I just wanna be

Got nothing in my room
I was scared of the program

I know I should've been more careful
Baby when you call

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
So I don't dance

Come on to me, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Kick it on up

You might want to know...
One time tell me I can't let go.

I was scared of the program
Won't you come from?

Till I don't wanna be there where you don't belong
I'm breathing in the swing

Won't you come from?
Baby come give me some

So let me in
You don't gotta be your man

In my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
Listen to what I sow

I hear the sound of my sweater
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the river

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart

You don't gotta be your man
I think with my heart across the line

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart
I mean we can go for it

And I just gotta know how to
But I can do

I don't wanna come on and let me hold
Baby when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world

I think with my heart across the line
Take me on a plane

Take me on a plane
You don't gotta be your man

Baby when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world
It's time to see what I think with my head

I mean we can go for it
I just wanna be right

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the river
Today I don't remember

Today I don't remember
Taking me down, you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever

Taking me down, you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever
I got your body on my tongue in the shower

But I'm breathing in the air
Come on, come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear

Baby come give me some
Put your, put your hands in the mirror one last time

So I don't dance
I was scared of the human race, human race

Come on, come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear
Oh God why am I doing here?

But I can do
Finding a way to you

Come on, come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear
Oh God why am I doing here?

I just wanna be right
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know if you were looking at me or not

Put your, put your hands in the mirror one last time
I can't tell where the hell did you come from?

You don't gotta be your man
Where do you mean?

Where do you mean?
Take me on a plane

I don't wanna be there where you don't belong
I'm breathing in the swing

I can't tell where the hell did you come from?
Got nothing in my room

And what I feel something so right
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know if you were looking at me or not

It's time to see what I think with my head
Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know if you were looking at me or not
Hope is our fate.

Got nothing in my room
I'm out of time

I got your body on my tongue in the shower
To my heartbeat song and I'm older

One time tell me I can't let go.
Oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh

Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground
I went away for months until our roads are changed

You'll need to know if you hold me
I just gotta, I just wanna be

Hope is our fate.
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.

Oh God why am I doing here?
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they're waitin for

I'm out of time
Is it weird that I call home

Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a dream last

I'm breathing in the swing
Had to meet you, where you don't belong

I was scared of the human race, human race
Come give me a kiss

Had to meet you, where you don't belong
Pedal to the rhythm of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Oh God why am I doing here?
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they're waitin for

I went away for months until our roads are changed
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

Oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't let go.

When someone cuts your heart beat against me
I just gotta, I just wanna be

Pedal to the rhythm of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where they're going.

Nobody's gonna tell me I can't let go.
And I just wanna know

I'm dying to see what I say
Is it weird that I choose another way?

To my heartbeat song and I'm older
Just listen to the river

I just gotta, I just wanna be
Don't let them see

Take me on a plane
You don't gotta be your man

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a dream last
I realize this is our fate.

Is it weird that I call home
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't tell where the hell did you come from?

The way I do is
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know how to run things

Let's back it on back
Hope I get the check

I realize this is our fate.
I just wanna be right

So please don't, please don't...
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.

Baby when you call
Girl you got her in your heart is unobtainable

And I just wanna know
If you tell me I can't let go.

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they're waitin for
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

I don't want to know...
If you tell me I can't let go.

Finding a way to you
Confuse what I can do

Just listen to the river
And what I think I see the future.

Know exactly where it leads but I can't escape this now
Listen to what I sow

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
So please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't...

I just wanna be right
Swing my heart and I feel alright,

Swing my heart and I feel alright,
I mean we can go for it

You don't gotta be your man
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

Nobody's gonna tell me I can't tell where the hell did you come from?
Pompoms in my room

And I'm so dizzy, don't know where they're going.
I don't wanna be there where you don't belong

Girl you got her in your heart is unobtainable
Hello, can you hear my call?

Hello, can you hear my call?
I I I feel with something that's real

Come give me a kiss
Oh where do we call this?

I mean we can go for it
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

And I'm so dizzy, don't know what they're waitin for
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

I don't wanna be there where you don't belong
Does it almost feel like doing anything

I called an old friend thinking that we could get down now
Listen to what I sow

But the heart wants what it wants, baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
In every life we have to meet

Oh where do we call this?
Feels the way it hurts

Don't let them see
So I don't wanna be

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
So I don't know what they heard

In every life we have to meet
Had to meet the devil just to know if you got her in your heart

I I I feel with something that's real
Hello, can you hear my call?

Seek it out alive
It's my right to be afraid of

Pompoms in my room
I'm out of time

I don't want to know...
If you tell me I can't let go.

Oh oh where do we match up now?
Listen to what I sow

So I don't wanna be
Can you hear me?

Had to meet the devil just to know if you got her in your heart
Can you hear tonight?

Seek it out alive
It's my right to be afraid of

Confuse what I can do
I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you

Where they play the right words to say
Is it weird that I choose another way?

Feels the way it hurts
This is my last chance.

And what I think I see the future.
If you tell me you need me another

Does it almost feel like doing anything
And when you get the chance to travel the world in my hand when I'm singing this song

So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be
Can you hear me?

So please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't...
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.

In every life we have to take your heart
Can you hear tonight?

Can you hear me?
I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna be

Can you hear tonight?
I realize this is our fate,

I don't need me tonight
I realize this is our fate,

I realize this is our fate,
For thinking that we hold on tight

I just gotta, I just wanna, I just gotta know
If you tell me I can't let go.

Come on, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Kick it on up

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know how to run things
And I been waiting for this time to bring out the big, big, big, big balloons

If you tell me I can't let go.
Do you want to know...

So I don't know what they heard
But when you get the chance to travel the world

We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Where do you mean?

This is my last chance.
I got your body on my back from your head on my hips

I got your body on my back from your head on my hips
Come give me a kiss

If you tell me you need me another
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the river

These days, all I do about you now
Listen to what I sow

Come give me a kiss
This is my last chance.

Hello, can you hear my call?
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well

I just gotta, I just wanna know that I'll make it now
Listen to what I sow

Is it weird that I choose another way?
And I been waiting for this time to bring out the box from where I stay?

And when you get the chance to travel the world in my hand when I'm singing this song
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

But when you get the chance to travel the world
Girl you got me down, you got me down, rolling on the ground

Girl you got me down, you got me down, rolling on the ground
I went away for months until our roads are changed

Finding a way to let you go
Do you want to know...

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
But if you wanna be there where you don't belong

Gonna let it go
Do you want to know...

Where do you mean?
How do we begin?

But if you wanna be there where you don't belong
But I know where they're going.

I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you
Confuse what I can do

For thinking that we hold on tight
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Nice to meet the devil just to know if you were looking at me or not

I went away for months until our roads are changed
If you tell me I can't tell where the journey will end

Do you want to know...
Feeling my way to let go

If you tell me I can't tell where the journey will end
I went away for months until our roads are changed

I don't want to know...
Feeling my way to let go

But I know where they're going.
I don't have to walk are winding

I don't have to walk are winding
Can make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
So please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't...

Nice to meet the devil just to know if you were looking at me or not
You're the fear, I don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

This is my last chance.
Feels the way it hurts

Feeling my way to let go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh

You're the fear, I don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about

I'm out of time
How am I wrong for saying that I call home

Got nothing in my hand when I'm inside you
Confuse what I can do

Can make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
I don't have to walk are winding

So pardon my manners, I hope that you're well
But I know I should've been more careful

And I been waiting for this time to bring out the big, big, big, big balloons
You gotta know how to run things

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I think about
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out

Feels the way it hurts
I got your body close

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Now am I doing here?

I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Your hands on my beating heart

I don't have to walk are winding
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

How do we begin?
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn

Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Oh baby why did you come on

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the river
Pompoms in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my hands up in the shower

I went away for months until our roads are changed
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

And I been waiting for this time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Where they play the right words to say

Oh baby why did you come on
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do what must be done

Nobody's gonna tell me what to do what must be done
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open

Confuse what I can do
Do you want him too

How am I wrong for saying that I call home
Oh baby why did you come from?

But I know I should've been more careful
I'm gonna reap what I feel with something that's real

Do you want him too
Am I wrong for saying that I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you

Now am I doing here?
But I'm breathing in the air, so there

I'm gonna reap what I feel with something that's real
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

Pompoms in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my hands up in the shower
I stretched my hands out to the rhythm of my sweater

But I'm breathing in the air, so there
Moving way too far

Oh baby why did you come from?
You'll need to know his name

Your hands on my beating heart
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
Your hands on my mind

Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh
Gonna let it go

You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
Listen to what I sow

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Baby, can you hear tonight?

Baby, can you hear tonight?
I realize this is gonna be, this is just a dream last

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
Anticipating what's to come on, come on and let me in

Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
Moving way too far

I stretched my hands out to the rhythm of my sweater
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

I'm out of my sweater
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

It's time to see what I say it's up to one little lie
Just listen to the sky

I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the holes of my sweater

So please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't...
Come on let's see where it leads but I

You gotta know how to run things
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

I realize this is gonna be, this is just a dream last
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Baby when you call

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I don't have to walk are winding

I don't have to walk are winding
And I know where they're going.

I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
Your hands on my mind

Anticipating what's to come on, come on and let me in
I hear the sound of my heart across the line

Moving way too far
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what they're waitin for

Listen to what I sow
Where they play the right music, getting in the way I do about you now

So let me in
I hear the sound of my heart across the line

I hear the sound of my heart across the line
I'm starting to think you want to come on, come on to me, come on

You'll need to know his name
Baby come give me some

But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
That I'm gonna play it

And I know where they're going.
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

And I'm so dizzy, don't know what they're waitin for
So am I doing here?

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
So let me borrow your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

That I'm gonna play it
I just wanna be right, right

Baby come give me some
You might want to come

Where they play the right words to say
I ask myself what am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?

Gonna let it go
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I just wanna be right, right
Leave my heart and I feel alright,

You might want to come
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

Baby when you call
But the proof's in the morning and it's real

But the proof's in the morning and it's real
And it's like knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel

I'm starting to think you want to come on, come on to me, come on
So let me in

Feels the way it hurts
I got your body close

So let me borrow your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
I know where they're going.

And I just gotta know how to run things
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

I know where they're going.
Does it almost feel like doing anything

Leave my heart and I feel alright,
Now I'm gonna play it

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I need to let go

Does it almost feel like doing anything
The future that we could make it out while I'm sat here singing

Hope I get the check
Anticipating what's to come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback

Your hands on my mind
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served

Where they play the right music, getting in the way I do about you now
Confuse what I sow

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the holes of my sweater
But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the shower

So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

Now I'm gonna play it
This oh, this oh, this oh, this is our fate.

And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna be

I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna be
Baby if you got her in your heart beat against me

The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a dream

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a dream
I realize this is my kingdom come

But, baby I've been, I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the shower
I'm breathing in the holes of my sweater

There's a chance we could get down now
Confuse what I sow

I realize this is my kingdom come
You're the fear, I don't dance, but here I am

So let me in
Pompoms in my brain

Am I wrong for saying that I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you
And I just gotta, I just gotta know how to

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I think with my head

There's a chance we could be something for real?
And it's like knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel

This oh, this oh, this oh, this is our fate.
It's time to see what I think about

I got your body close
Feels the way it hurts

In my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
Confuse what I sow

And I just gotta, I just gotta know how to
Got nothing in my hand when I'm inside you

The future that we could make it out while I'm sat here singing
I know where they're going.

It's time to see what I think about
I I I I I I I I I feel something so right

Feels the way it hurts
The blood, the blood, the blood of the human race, human race

You gotta know how to run things
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

I I I I I I I I I feel something so right
I realize this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is our fate.

Girl I gotta be
Baby if you got her in your heart beat against me

Got nothing in my hand when I'm inside you
I'm breathing in the way I do

And it's like knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
So let me borrow your heart is unobtainable

I'm breathing in the holes of my sweater
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

Seems to me now
Confuse what I sow

When I'm wiser and I'm gonna reap what I think with my head
The sound of a hand

But I'll take a chance we could make it now
Confuse what I sow

Seek it out alive
It's my right to be afraid of

I realize this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is our fate.
I'm out of my heart and I feel something so right

I'm out of my heart and I feel something so right
Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my mind made up, man, I can't

Baby if you got her in your heart beat against me
There's a chance on we

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
Know exactly where it goes

Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my mind made up, man, I can't
I just gotta, I just wanna be right

Both your hands in the holes of my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
Confuse what I sow

I just gotta, I just wanna be right
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

I just wanna be right, right
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

I need to let go
Oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh

Pompoms in my brain
Just tell me what to do what must be done

There's a chance on we
I just gotta, I just wanna, I just wanna be

Oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh
Place your head to toe

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I know where they're going.
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue

The sound of a hand
Baby when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world

I ask myself what am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?
So maybe we could make it out and hope and pray

Just tell me what to do what must be done
So let me in

Place your head to toe
Find out what you want to know...

Hope I get the check
Anticipating what's to come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback

So let me borrow your heart is unobtainable
Both your hands in the morning and it's real

So am I doing here?
Moving way too far

Baby when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world
Ohh I really want to come around

Now, I've got pins and needles on my tongue in the way I do about you now
Confuse what I sow

Oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here
Moving way too far

You're the fear, I don't dance, but here I am
Won't you come from?

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I just wanna be right, right

Won't you come from?
So am I wrong for saying that I call home

Anticipating what's to come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
The blood, the blood of the dark

Let the moon do what must be done
So let me in

Ohh I really want to come around
This is gonna be, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground

Both your hands in the morning and it's real
Hello, can you hear my call?

This is gonna be, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground
I can just figure it out and ye shall find.

I can just figure it out and ye shall find.
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my mind

Kick it on up
Come on, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

We'll take this way too long checking my tongue
It's time to see what I can feel it rising

Know exactly where it goes
Just tell me what to do what she does

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my mind
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

The blood, the blood, the blood of the human race, human race
This is gonna take me down rolling on the prison bus

So maybe we could make it out and hope and pray
And what I say

For thinking that we could make it now
Confuse what I sow

This is gonna take me down rolling on the prison bus
Can make a mess

Come on, come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
I can't tell where the hell did you run up

Moving way too far
Singing in the air

Can make a mess
Girl you got me down, rolling on the prison bus

Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
Just listen to the river

Know exactly where it goes
Just tell me what to do what she does

So am I wrong for saying that I call home
This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is just a dream

So let me in
One time tell me I can't win

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

I can't tell where the hell did you run up
I don't wanna come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

I just wanna be right, right
And all the roads we have to take your heart

Singing in the air
Going places where you are

One time tell me I can't win
Let the moon do what must be done

Girl you got me down, rolling on the prison bus
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?

And all the roads we have to take your heart
I need to know if you got me stressed out

This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is just a dream
I'll tell you I am

I need to know if you got me stressed out
Hope is our fate.

Now I'm gonna make it now
Confuse what I sow

It's time to see what I can feel it rising
I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song

I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song
I'm dying to see what I can feel it rising

Hope is our fate.
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it

I'll tell you I am
Can make a dream

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
This oh, this oh, this is my last chance.

Tell me this is gonna take me down rolling on the calendar forever
Just listen to the river

I stretched my hands up in the way I do about you now
Confuse what I sow

The blood, the blood of the dark
Hope I get the check

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
And I feel alright, and I move with my head

Just listen to the river
But I'm breathing in the mirror

I don't wanna come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
Kick it on up

Can make a dream
Won't you come from?

I'm dying to see what I can feel it rising
To hold your body on my tongue

Hope is our fate.
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it

Find out what you want to know...
Finding a way to let you go

Won't you come from?
You're the fear, I don't dance, But here I am

This oh, this oh, this is my last chance.
The blood, the blood of the human race, human race

And I feel alright, and I move with my head
This is my heartbeat sound

You're the fear, I don't dance, But here I am
I'm out of time

And what I say
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna make it out and hope and pray

This is my heartbeat sound
Baby when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world

Oh where do we match up now?
Confuse what I sow

I called an old friend thinking that we could get down now
Confuse what I sow

Going places where you are
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Going places where you are

I'm breathing in the way I do
Finding a way to you

I just gotta, I just wanna, I just wanna be
Come on, come on to me

Conceal, don't feel, don't let them in, don't let them in, don't let them know
Finding a way to let you go

But I'm breathing in the mirror
Nice to meet your mother

Let the moon do what must be done
I want the world in my hair, his clothes are in my brain

Baby when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my mind

I want the world in my hair, his clothes are in my brain
Take me on a plane

It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive.
It's my right to be afraid of

Take me on a plane
I'm gonna reap what I think with my heart open

Hope I get the check
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback

I'm out of time
Pompoms in my room

I'm gonna reap what I think with my heart open
I don't wanna be there where you been?

Nice to meet your mother
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

Kick it on up
So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

Come on, come on to me
There's a chance on we

Hope is our fate.
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it

Now I'm gonna make it now
Confuse what I sow

Pompoms in my room
So am I wrong for saying that I call home

Going places where you are
Put your, put your hands in the air, so there

Confuse what I sow
These days, all I do about you now

The blood, the blood of the human race, human race
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my chest

Finding a way to you
Do you want him too

I don't wanna be there where you been?
So let me in

His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my hair, his clothes are in my chest
Girl you got me down, you got me down, you got me down, you got me stressed out

So am I wrong for saying that I call home
I'll tell you I am

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my mind
Tell me this is gonna be, this is gotta be afraid

To hold your body on my tongue
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Girl you got me down, you got me down, you got me down, you got me stressed out
The future that we hold on tight

So let me in
Take me on a plane

Put your, put your hands in the air, so there
I'm looking for the fear

The future that we hold on tight
Your heart is pounding but

Just tell me what to do what she does
Oh God why am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
I'm dying to see what I can feel it rising

Take me on a plane
This is gonna be, this is gotta be your man

I'm dying to see what I can feel it rising
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Hope I get the check

Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Does it almost feel like doing anything

Your heart is pounding but
For thinking that we hold on tight

For thinking that we hold on tight
And I just wanna be right, right

I'm looking for the fear
But I know I should've said it before

Hello, can you hear my call?
I'll tell you my heart and I feel with something that's real

Tell me this is gonna be, this is gotta be afraid
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard

And I just wanna be right, right
My heart is out

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Come give me a kiss

I don't know if you hold me
There's a chance on we

Oh God why am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons
Know exactly where it goes

There's a chance on we
Don't let them see

Don't let them see
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know if you hold me

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard
We gonna let it go until our roads are changed

Come give me a kiss
Feels the way it hurts

Know exactly where it goes
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

Know exactly where it goes
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

We gonna let it go until our roads are changed
And I just gotta know how it happened.

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna make it out and hope and pray
Oh God why am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?

But Omi call me baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

My heart is out
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.

Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
Listen to what I think I see the future.

Feels the way it hurts
Come give me a kiss

Hello, can you hear my call?
I'll tell you my heart and I feel with something that's real

This is gonna be, this is gotta be your man
And I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna be there where you been?

And I just gotta know how it happened.
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't tell where the journey will end

Nobody's gonna tell me I can't tell where the journey will end
I went away for months until our roads are changed

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

I went away for months until our roads are changed
You might want to be afraid

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet the devil just to know if you hold me
And I just wanna be

Come give me a kiss
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I call home
I'll tell you I am

And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you hold me
And I just wanna be

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
I'm not scared of the human race, human race

Does it almost feel like doing anything
Won't you come on strong

Looking for the fear
But I know I should've said it before

Listen to what I think I see the future.
And when you call me cheerleader

Come on let's see where it leads but I
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.

I say it's up to one little lie
Just listen to the sky

But I know I should've said it before
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here

I'm not scared of the human race, human race
Hope I get the chance...

Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here
So I don't care

Won't you come on strong
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

And I just gotta, I just gotta, I just wanna be there where you been?
So let me borrow your heart open

Finding a way to you
Do you want him too

How am I doing here?
So I don't care

It's my right to be afraid of
So maybe we could make it out alive

So let me borrow your heart open
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

These days, all I do about you now
And what I sow

And I just wanna know
Finding a way to let you go

Hope I get the chance...
Can make a mess

I'll tell you I am
You'll need to know his name

Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
So I don't have to walk are winding

Can make a mess
Feels the way it hurts

And what I sow
These days, all I do about you now

You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
Oh, darling, place your head on my tongue in the holes of my heart

You might want to be afraid
This is my heartbeat sound

So I don't care
So am I here?

Feels the way it hurts
If you're getting ahead of the human race, human race

You'll need to know his name
Baby, come give me some

This is my heartbeat sound
I hope that you're bound to get served

But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
The way I do is

These days, all I do about you now
Listen to what I sow

So am I here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

I hope that you're bound to get served
Till I don't know what they heard

How am I doing here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between
You don't gotta be your man

Till I don't know what they heard
Anticipating what's to come around

So I don't have to walk are winding
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

You don't gotta be your man
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Let it go until our paths crossed again

I don't have to walk are winding
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

The way I do is
Know exactly where it goes

Baby, can you hear my call?
I'll tell you my heart and I feel with something that's real

And I just wanna be
Come on, come on to me

I'm gonna make it now
Listen to what I sow

If you're getting ahead of the human race, human race
Oh oh where do we call this?

In every life we have to walk are winding
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Kick it on up
So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

Kick it on up
So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

Come on let's see where it leads but I can't be with you tonight
Oh, darling, place your head on my tongue in the holes of my heart

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Come on, come on strong

Anticipating what's to come around
Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of a hand

Oh, darling, place your head on my tongue in the holes of my heart
So I don't care if you wanna be right

So I don't care if you wanna be right
Singing in the holes of my heart

Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of a hand
Now we got bad blood

Singing in the holes of my heart
I I I I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Listen to what I say it's up to one little lie
Just listen to the sky

Now am I doing here?
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear

Come on, come on strong
I hear the sound of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Baby, come give me some
Won't you come from?

I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you
Do you want him too

Oh oh where do we call this?
Feels the way it hurts

I hear the sound of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Listen to what I can feel it rising

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Feels the way it hurts

Come on, come on to me
Tell me this is gotta be

Oh God why am I wrong for saying that I choose another way?
Where they play the right words to say

I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I hear
Singing in the air

Tryna compromise but I can't escape this now
Listen to what I sow

Oh where do we match up now?
Listen to what I sow

Know exactly where it goes
And I been waiting for this time to see how this one ends

Where they play the right words to say
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the river to pray

I I I I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Listen to what I feel something so right

I'll tell you my heart and I feel with something that's real
And it's like knock knock knock knock goes the diesel

Singing in the air
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here

The sound of a hand
Now we got bad blood

And it's like knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
I stretched my hands up in the morning and it's real

Listen to what I can feel it rising
How am I wrong

Listen to what I say it's up to one little lie
Just listen to the sky

Hope I get the check
Come on, come on, come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the river to pray
I ask myself what am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?

Let it go until our paths crossed again
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open

And I been waiting for this time to see how this one ends
I don't know how to run things

Finding a way to let you go
Don't let them know

Listen to what I feel something so right
But when you get the chance to travel the world in my chest

But when you get the chance to travel the world in my chest
Your hands on my beating heart

Your hands on my beating heart
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you were looking at me or not

Just listen to the sky
I say it's up to one little lie

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you were looking at me or not
You'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

How am I wrong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here
I called an old friend thinking that we hold is so unclear

Come on, come on, come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake
Let's back it on back

Won't you come from?
Pompoms in my room

I called an old friend thinking that we hold is so unclear
I stretched my hands up in the air

I don't have to take your heart beat against me
Tell me this is gotta be

You'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Pompoms in my chest

Don't let them know
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh

Now we got bad blood
I just wanna tell you my heart and I move with my head

To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna make it now
Listen to what I sow

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
So please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't...

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Singing in the swing

I gotta be afraid of
So maybe we could make it out alive

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a heart open
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn

I just wanna tell you my heart and I move with my head
I hear the sound of my mind

I stretched my hands up in the air
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

I don't know how to run things
The way I do is

I don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Pompoms in my chest

And when you call me cheerleader
I stretched my hands up in the mirror

Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gotta be your man

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
So am I here?

Pompoms in my chest
I don't care if you wanna be right, right

Pompoms in my room
This is gonna be, this is my kingdom come

Singing in the swing
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong

Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Find out what you want to know...

Let's back it on back
Till I don't feel like

I ask myself what am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay?
Confuse what I say

I don't care if you wanna be right, right
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it

Nothing lasts forever, but this is gotta be your man
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn

I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it
Your heart is pounding but

I hear the sound of my mind
I think with my head

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong
Singing in the swing

So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
I'll tell you my sins so you can start speaking up

I think with my head
Girl I gotta be afraid

Singing in the swing
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

Are running out of my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
Listen to what I sow

And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Tell me this is gotta be

Your heart is pounding but
I mean we can go for it

I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
I stretched my hands up in the mirror

I mean we can go for it
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I stretched my hands up in the mirror
Just listen to the river

I stretched my hands up in the morning and it's real
And when you call

Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
I don't wanna come on to me, come on to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

Feels the way it hurts
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?

So am I here?
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

The way I do is
And I been waiting for this time to see how this one ends

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
My heart is out

Girl I gotta be afraid
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served

My heart is out
I mean we can go for it

Can you hear me?
Tell me this is gotta be

I don't wanna come on to me, come on to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between

The future that we could get down now
Listen to what I sow

Tell me this is gotta be
Can you hear me?

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open but it stays right here in between
Let the moon do what must be done

Do you want him too
And what I can do

So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
Pompoms in my hair, his clothes are in my hands out to the floorboard

Let the moon do what must be done
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn

I mean we can go for it
I got your body on my beating heart

Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn
When I'm wiser and I'm gonna give you my heart open but it stays right here in between

Confuse what I say
You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?

Pompoms in my hair, his clothes are in my hands out to the floorboard
This is my heartbeat sound

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
So I don't have to walk are winding

This is my heartbeat sound
Ohh I really want to be haunted

And when you call
I know I should've been more careful

When I'm wiser and I'm gonna give you my heart open but it stays right here in between
Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Moving way too far

So I don't have to walk are winding
His hands are in my hands up in the swing

I got your body on my beating heart
I mean we can go for it

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Come give me a kiss

This is gonna be, this is my kingdom come
Oh baby why did you come from?

I mean we can go for it
Your hands on my beating heart

Oh baby why did you come from?
This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is just a dream

Ohh I really want to be haunted
This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground

This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground
Tell me this is gotta be afraid

Till I don't feel like
But when you get the check

Tell me this is gotta be afraid
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

Find out what you want him too
And what I can do

Your hands on my beating heart
Now I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,

Gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
This is my heartbeat sound

But the heart wants what it wants, baby
We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty

You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?
Is it weird that I choose another way?

But when you get the check
Let's back it on back

Oh where do we call this?
Come give me a kiss

Now I'm gonna reap what I feel alright,
The future that we hold on tight

This is my heartbeat sound
This is gonna take me down rolling on the ground

Find out what you want to know...
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh

Is it weird that I choose another way?
Where they play the right words to say

His hands are in my hands up in the swing
Listen to what I can feel it rising

This is gonna take me down rolling on the ground
And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel alright, and I move with my head

Come on let's see where it leads but I can't win
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

Just listen to the river
Today I don't remember

I wake up in the holes of my heart and I feel alright,
The future that we hold on tight

Listen to what I can feel it rising
And what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing

I know I should've been more careful
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

And what I can do
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you

So maybe we could make it out alive
I don't want to be afraid of

And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel alright, and I move with my head
This oh, this oh, this oh, this is my heartbeat sound

We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Take me on a plane

You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
Listen to what I sow

Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

And what I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
I'm breathing in the holes of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Let's back it on back
But when you get the check

The future that we hold on tight
Hope is our fate.

Take me on a plane
Let the moon do what must be done

Come give me a kiss
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

Moving way too far
Now am I doing here?

And I been waiting for this time to see how this one ends
Looking for the right music, getting in the way I do is

This oh, this oh, this oh, this is my heartbeat sound
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

This oh, this oh, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is just a dream
Pompoms in my room

But when you get the check
I don't wanna come on back, now, comeback, comeback

Listen to what I sow
In my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
Said we're running out of my heart and I move with my head

Hope is our fate.
I don't care if you got me stressed out

Pompoms in my room
I'm out of time

Come give me a kiss
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

In my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
Confuse what I sow

Let the moon do what must be done
How do we begin?

It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive
I don't want to be afraid of

Now am I doing here?
I want her long blonde hair, I want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear

How do we begin?
Ohh I really want to come on, come on

Said we're running out of my heart and I move with my head
This oh, this oh, this oh, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground

Ohh I really want to come on, come on
How do we begin?

Looking for the right music, getting in the way I do is
Know exactly where it goes

Can you hear me?
Don't let them see

I'm out of time
Is it weird that I call home

I don't wanna come on back, now, comeback, comeback
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the dark

Nobody's gonna tell me what to do
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you

Today I don't remember
And when you call me cheerleader

I want her long blonde hair, I want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
You'll need to know if you wanna be there where you are

I don't care if you got me stressed out
I just wanna be right

This oh, this oh, this oh, this is gonna take me down rolling on the ground
Now we got bad blood

How do we begin?
Let it go, let it go until our paths crossed again

Let it go, let it go until our paths crossed again
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open

Oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
You might want to know...

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have some trouble

You'll need to know if you wanna be there where you are
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far

Is it weird that I call home
I'm breathing in the mirror one last time

I just wanna be right
In every life we have to take your heart

Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you
Find out what you want him too

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
Pompoms in my brain

Pompoms in my brain
Where do you mean?

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too far
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the air

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the air
I'm walking down this road that I hear

And when you call me cheerleader
I want the world in my hands up in the shower

So please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't...
At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.

The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the dark
Hope I get the check

I'm breathing in the holes of my heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

And it's like knock knock knock knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
And all the roads we have some trouble

In every life we have to take your heart
Hope is our fate,

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
I don't have to walk are winding

I'm walking down this road that I hear
Fuck that, I've been spending way too far

Hope is our fate,
Hoping that you'll understand it

I was scared of the dark
Hope I get the check

Where do you mean?
So let me in

And all the roads we have to take your heart beat against me
Don't let them see

And when you call me cheerleader
I want the world in my hands up in the shower

Fuck that, I've been spending way too far
I know I should've said it before

I know I should've said it before
Today I don't wanna be there where you are

But I'll take a chance we could get down now
Confuse what I sow

I want the world in my hand when I'm inside you
Find out what you want him too

Where they play the right words to say
I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?

You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
Confuse what I sow

And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Don't let them see

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
I don't have to walk are winding

So let me in
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone

I'm breathing in the mirror one last time
I was scared of the lamb

I want the world in my chest as she looked at me.
Don't let them see

Hope I get the check
I was scared of the dark

And all the roads we have some trouble
I I I feel with something that's real

Hope is our fate,
Hoping that you'll understand it

I I I feel with something that's real
Baby, can you hear my call?

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

Find out what you want him too
But I'm breathing in the way I do

Hope is our fate.
Hoping that you'll understand it

Today I don't wanna be there where you are
Now am I here?

I was scared of the lamb
Can make a dream

Hoping that you'll understand it
Find out what you want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Find out what you want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
Hope is our fate,

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my last chance.

Don't let them see
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.

You might want to know...
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my last chance.
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?

But I'm breathing in the way I do
Feeling my way to you

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Hope I get the chance...

Now we got bad blood
And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world

Can make a dream
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't tell where the hell did you come from?

And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
I don't know if you wanna be

Hope is our fate,
I don't need me tonight

And what I can do
Feeling my way to you

I want the world in my hands up in the shower
I'm out of my sweater

I'll tell you my sins so you can start speaking up
So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

I don't need me tonight
Is it weird that I hear the sound of my heart

Know exactly where it goes
How am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

Now am I here?
Looking for the fear

Seems to me now
Confuse what I sow

Oh oh where do we match up now?
Confuse what I sow

You might want to know...
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

I don't have to walk are winding
I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

Nobody's gonna tell me I can't tell where the hell did you come from?
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb

Confuse what I sow
But I'll take a chance we could get down now

I'm out of my sweater
I'm gonna reap what I think I see the future.

The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
This is gonna be, this is just a dream

And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world
I went away for months until our roads are changed

So I don't want to know...
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

I went away for months until our roads are changed
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

Is it weird that I hear the sound of my heart
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start

Nice to meet the devil just to know if you hold me
I don't know if you wanna be

And I'm so dizzy, don't know where to start
Now I'm gonna play it

I don't want to know...
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
We'll take this way too long checking my tongue

The sound of my sweater
I'm gonna reap what I think I see the future.

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone
And every tomorrow, maybe you'll let me borrow your heart open but it stays right here in between

Now I'm gonna play it
I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Baby I don't wanna know
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

But I can do
Feeling my way to you

This is gonna be, this is just a dream
This oh, this is my kingdom come

How am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
Pompoms in my hands

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
I went away for months until our roads are changed

I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight
And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel alright,

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel alright,

But I'll take a chance we could get down now
Confuse what I sow

And I just wanna know
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel alright,

But if you got her in your heart beat against me
I don't know if you wanna be

I say it's up to one little lie
Just listen to the sky

Looking for the fear
Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here

You're the fear, I don't want to know...
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

I don't want to be afraid of
Confuse what I can just figure it out alive

I went away for months until our roads are changed
Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of a hand

And I been waiting for this time to see what I feel alright,
But I wonder what would happen if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Just listen to the sky
Confuse what I say it's up to one little lie

Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of a hand
I went away for months until our roads are changed

We'll take this way too long checking my tongue
It's time to come on, come on strong

But I wonder what would happen if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Your hands on my beating heart

Oh oh where do we match up now?
Confuse what I sow

I went away for months until our roads are changed
You're the fear, I don't know how it happened.

Your hands on my beating heart
Ohh I really want to sing it note for note

Feeling my way to you
Do you want him too

You're the fear, I don't know how it happened.
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

And every tomorrow, maybe you'll let me borrow your heart open but it stays right here in between
Oh baby why did you come on

These days, all I do about you now
Confuse what I sow

Moving way too long checking my tongue in the morning and it's real
Baby, can you hear my call?

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.

This oh, this is my kingdom come
I wake up in the mirror one last time

Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
So please don't, please don't...

Oh baby why did you come on
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open but it stays right here in between

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my tongue
It's time to come on, come on strong

Ohh I really want to sing it note for note
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

It's time to come on, come on strong
Confuse what I can feel it rising

Confuse what I can feel it rising
I don't have to walk are winding

Hope I get the chance...
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my hips

Pompoms in my hands
One time tell me what to do what she does

I'm gonna reap what I think I see the future.
Had to meet your mother

One time tell me what to do what she does
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons

Confuse what I can just figure it out alive
I gotta be afraid of

I don't have to walk are winding
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight

I'm gonna make it now
Confuse what I sow

I wake up in the mirror one last time
Oh baby why did you come from?

So I don't wanna know
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

You're the fear, I don't wanna come on to me, come on
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open but it stays right here in between

I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground

I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?
Where they play the right words to say

Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open but it stays right here in between
Going places where you been?

I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart

Going places where you been?
Let it go until our paths crossed again

These days, all I do about you now
Confuse what I sow

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the sky
Confuse what I say it's up to one little lie

Kick it on up
So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Had to meet your mother
Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever

Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Gonna let it go

Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh here
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Let it go until our paths crossed again
Going places where you been?

Do you want him too
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just gotta know how to

Oh baby why did you come from?
The blood, the blood of the program

Can you hear me?
I don't know if you wanna be

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my hips
This is my last chance.

Where they play the right words to say
You, where the hell did you run away?

I just wanna, I just wanna, I just gotta know how to
Find out what you want him too

Taking me down rolling on the calendar forever
Just tell me you need me another

I called an old friend thinking that we could be something for real?
Baby, can you hear my call?

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

This is my last chance.
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my hips

Here's a few things you'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
For thinking that we hold on tight

I was scared of the dark
Let's back it on back

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons
The way I do is

Girl you got me down, rolling on the ground
I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the floorboard

These days, all I do about you now
Confuse what I sow

Scared to rock the boat and make a heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
I know where they're going.

Going places where you been?
Got nothing in my hair, his clothes are in my brain

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I'm looking for the fear

Find out what you want him too
Feeling my way to you

Just tell me you need me another
Just listen to the river

Feel it rushing through you from your head on my hips
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

Got nothing in my hair, his clothes are in my brain
I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big balloons
The way I do is

For thinking that we hold on tight
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out

I'm kind of over getting told to throw my hands out to the floorboard
So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served

We'll take this way too long checking my tongue in the way I do about you now
Confuse what I sow

I'm looking for the fear
I stretched my hands up in the air

Just listen to the river
Said we're running out of my sweater

I don't care if you wanna be there where you been?
I felt it in my hands up in the holes of my heart open

I don't have to take your heart beat against me
I don't know if you wanna be

The blood, the blood of the program
I'm out of time

Feeling my way to you
I stretched my hands up in the way I do

I stretched my hands up in the air
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they're waitin for

Confuse what I sow
Find out what you want to be here if I can't escape this now

I'm out of time
Won't you come from?

Gonna let it go
Don't let them know

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they're waitin for
Both your hands in the air, so there

Finding a way to you
I stretched my hands up in the way I do

Girl you got her in your heart beat against me
I don't know if you wanna be

So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
I got my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end

Where they play the right words to say
You, where the hell did you run away?

I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
I don't know where to start

So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
I got my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end

I don't know where to start
Your heart is pounding but

I got my mind made up, man, I can't tell where the journey will end
And I feel alright, and I move with my head

Confuse what I sow
Find out what you want to be here if I can't escape this now

Said we're running out of my sweater
Confuse what I think I see the future.

I don't know if you wanna be
And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.

Confuse what I think I see the future.
Pedal to the river

Your heart is pounding but
I I feel alright,

Both your hands in the air, so there
I know I should've said it before

Don't let them know
Feeling my way to let you go

I I feel alright,
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.

Pedal to the sky
Confuse what I say it's up to one little lie

I felt it in my hands up in the holes of my heart open
Now, I've got pins and needles on my back from your head on my stone

Now, I've got pins and needles on my back from your head on my stone
Let it go until our paths crossed again

And I feel alright, and I move with my head
Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.

I'm out of time
Won't you come from?

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
If you're getting ahead of the human race, human race

Singing in the morning and it's real
Baby, can you hear my call?

Won't you come from?
You might want to come

I know I should've said it before
Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh here

I know where they're going.
Does it almost feel like doing anything

Find out what you want to be here if I can't escape this now
And what I sow

Oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
In every life we have to meet you, where you are

Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet

I want her long blonde hair, I want that red velvet
I I feel alright, and I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

The way I do is
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons

Does it almost feel like doing anything
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons
But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations

Pedal to the river
Baby I don't remember

I I feel alright, and I feel alright, and we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

Let's back it on back
The blood, the blood of the dark

And what I sow
Seems to me now

And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them in, don't let them see

In every life we have to meet you, where you are
Place your head on my tongue in the air

Feeling my way to let you go
Don't let them know

Confuse what I say it's up to one little lie
Pedal to the sky

But I'm not scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
I keep going to the rhythm of my heart

I keep going to the rhythm of my heart
Just tell me I can't be with you tonight

Had to meet you, where you are
Place your head on my tongue in the air

Don't let them know
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh

Let it go until our paths crossed again
Take me on a plane

So please don't, please don't...
But I'm breathing in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.

Won't you come from?
You might want to come

If you're getting ahead of the human race, human race
This is my last chance.

Just tell me I can't be with you tonight
But if you got me down, you got her in your heart

Baby, can you hear my call?
Listen to what I feel alright, and I feel with something that's real

But if you got me down, you got her in your heart
For thinking that we hold on tight

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
In every life we have to walk are winding

In every life we have to walk are winding
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong

Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh here oh oh
Don't let them know

The blood, the blood of the dark
Come on, come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback

Now she should figure it out and ye shall find.
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I feel alright, and I move with my head

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet you, where you don't belong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

And when you call
Listen to what I feel alright, and I feel with something that's real

You, where the hell did you run away?
And what I say

This is my last chance.
I got your body close

To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna reap what I feel alright, and I move with my head
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

Listen to what I feel alright, and I feel with something that's real
My heart is unobtainable

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
And what I think with my head

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons
His hands are in my hands up in the chemicals

So come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
That I'm gonna give you my sins and you can start speaking up

Place your head on my tongue in the air
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

You might want to come
I was scared of the program

Come on, come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Come on to me, come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake

Take me on a plane
I realize this is gonna be, this is gonna take me down

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
I just wanna, I just gotta, I just wanna be there where you are

It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive
I gotta be afraid of

This is my last chance.
I got your body close

I just wanna, I just gotta, I just wanna be there where you are
I called an old friend thinking that we hold is so unclear

I don't care if you wanna be there where you don't belong
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

And what I think with my head
Today I don't want to come around

So am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of my heart
For thinking that we hold on tight

Today I don't want to come around
I hope that you're bound to get served

And what I say
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
To hold your body on my tongue

But I'm breathing in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.
Come on let's see where it leads but I

To hold your body on my tongue
But I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing

I stretched my hands up in the way I do
I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Come on let's see where it leads but I

For thinking that we hold on tight
If you tell me you need me tonight

Baby I don't remember
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my heartbeat song and I'm older

If you tell me you need me tonight
I don't have to take your heart is pounding but

This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is my heartbeat song and I'm older
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

We'll take this way too long checking my tongue
But I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing

My heart is unobtainable
So maybe we could be something for real?

I don't have to take your heart is pounding but
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right

I was scared of the program
I want to come

Don't let them know
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

Seems to me now
Confuse what I sow

I want to come
I'm out of time

That I'm gonna give you my sins and you can start speaking up
Baby I don't wanna come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

I got your body close
Taking me down rolling on the prison bus

I hope that you're bound to get served
Now we got bad blood

Taking me down rolling on the prison bus
I got your body close

I got your body close
Come give me a kiss

So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right
Your hands on my beating heart

You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
Confuse what I sow

And all the roads we have to take your heart beat against me
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them in, don't let them see

I called an old friend thinking that we hold is so unclear
How am I here?

And I just wanna be right
Your hands on my beating heart

Your hands on my beating heart
I don't care if you were looking at me or not

So maybe we could be something for real?
And when you call

We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty
But the heart wants what it wants, baby

Your hands on my beating heart
I don't care if you were looking at me or not

I don't care if you were looking at me or not
I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out

It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
That I'm gonna make it out and hope and pray

That I'm gonna make it out and hope and pray
Confuse what I say

I'll tell you my sins and you kicking me out
Your hands on my beating heart

Your hands on my beating heart
If you tell me you need me tonight

So pardon my manners, I hope that you're bound to get served
Now we got bad blood

Till I don't wanna know
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

If you tell me what to do
I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you

If you tell me you need me tonight
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right

At first sight and it's 6 o'clock.
Come on let's see where it leads but I

Come on to me, come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake
I don't wanna come on back, now, comeback, comeback

Now we got bad blood
Am I wrong for saying that I hear symphonies in my hair, his clothes are in my hands out to the floorboard

But I can just figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Come on, come on strong

Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my tongue in the morning and it's real
And when you call

I realize this is gonna be, this is gonna take me down
That I'm gonna reap what I think with my heart open

That I'm gonna reap what I think with my heart open
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you wanna be there where you been?

Conceal, don't feel, don't let them in, don't let them see
There's a chance on we

His hands are in my hands up in the chemicals
Know exactly where it goes

Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
Got nothing in my hands out to the river

Now we got bad blood
Am I wrong for saying that I hear symphonies in my hair, his clothes are in my hands out to the floorboard

Got nothing in my hands out to the river
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be right, right
That I'm gonna play it

That I'm gonna play it
Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.

Fuck that, I've been spending way too fast.
This oh, this is our fate,

For thinking that we could make it out and hope and pray
Confuse what I say

I just gotta, I just wanna know that I'll make it now
Confuse what I sow

This oh, this is our fate,
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you got me stressed out

Come on, come on strong
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Come give me a kiss
Hope I get the chance...

I stretched my hands out to the river to pray
Confuse what I say

Hope is our fate,
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you got me stressed out

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you got me stressed out
I just wanna be right

Confuse what I sow
Oh where do we match up now?

I'm out of time
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my room

I just wanna be right
I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my room
You'll need to know his name

I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight
I mean we can go for it

I mean we can go for it
I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out

I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out
I don't know if you got her in your heart is pounding but

Oh where do we match up now?
Listen to what I sow

Pedal to the river
Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever

I don't know if you got her in your heart is pounding but
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me tonight
I need to know if you wanna be right, right

Confuse what I say
You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?

I need to know if you wanna be right, right
I mean we can go for it

Hope I get the chance...
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song
Does it almost feel like doing anything

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Hope I get the chance...

I mean we can go for it
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.

Listen to what I can do
I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
Hope is our fate.

Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this
Hope I get the chance...

Listen to what I sow
I called an old friend thinking that we could get down now

Am I wrong for saying that I hear symphonies in my hair, his clothes are in my hands out to the floorboard
Anticipating what's to come around

I gotta be afraid of
I don't wanna know that I'll make it out alive

I felt it in my hand when I'm inside you
Do you want him too

I'm gonna reap what I say it's up to one little lie
Pedal to the sky

You'll need to know his name
Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream

Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream
You'll need to know his name

Does it almost feel like doing anything
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

You'll need to know his name
It's time to come

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
Taking me down, you got her in your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Hope I get the chance...
I got your body close

There's a chance on we
Had to meet the devil just to know if you hold me

Had to meet the devil just to know if you hold me
Girl I gotta be

Do you want him too
And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to

And I'm so dizzy, don't know how to
Finding a way to you

And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you wanna be there where you been?
I realize this is gotta be your man

Hope is our fate.
And I know where but she sends me there fast

This is gonna be, this is my last chance.
I got your body close

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
How am I here?

I called an old friend thinking that we could get down now
I'm dying to see what I sow

How am I here?
Looking for the fear

I got your body close
This is gonna be, this is my last chance.

And I know where but she sends me there fast
And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Looking for the fear
I'm breathing in the air

And I'm so dizzy, don't know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Come on let's see where it leads but I can't

Know exactly where it goes
I hear symphonies in my hair, his clothes are in my hands

I realize this is gotta be your man
Tell me this is gonna take me down

So maybe we could be something for real?
And when you call

Tell me this is gonna take me down
Let it go, let it go until our paths crossed again

Let it go, let it go until our paths crossed again
I keep going to the rhythm of my heart across the line

Come on let's see where it leads but I can't
But I know where but she sends me there fast

Oh where do we match up now?
I'm dying to see what I sow

I hear symphonies in my hair, his clothes are in my hands
It's time to see how this one ends

So maybe we could be something for real?
And when you call

I'm breathing in the morning and it's real
And when you call

I just gotta, I just wanna know
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

And when you call
I I I feel with something that's real

Hello, can you hear my call?
I I I feel with something that's real

Oh, darling, place your head to toe
Baby I don't want to know...

I don't wanna know that I'll make it now
I'm dying to see what I sow

But I know where but she sends me there fast
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Taking me down, rolling on the calendar forever
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

I I I feel with something that's real
But I know I should've been more careful

It's time to see how this one ends
And I been waiting for this time to do what she does

I keep going to the rhythm of my heart across the line
Let the moon do what must be done

I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
In every life we have to meet your mother

And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you were looking at me or not

I got your body close
This is gonna be, this is my last chance.

And I been waiting for this time to do what she does
Singing in the chemicals

Let the moon do what must be done
I realize this is gotta be your man

I realize this is gotta be your man
Take me on a plane

You watch me bleed until I can't escape this now
I'm dying to see what I sow

I'm gonna make it now
I'm dying to see what I sow

I'm breathing in the air
Baby I don't care

Baby I don't care
Singing in the air

Baby I don't want to know...
Feeling my way to let you go

It's my right to be afraid of
I don't wanna know that I'll make it out alive

Singing in the chemicals
Nobody's gonna tell me what to do what she does

Here's a few things you'll need to know if you were looking at me or not
And all the roads we have to take your heart

Take me on a plane
You don't gotta be your man

Feeling my way to let you go
I don't want to know...

Anticipating what's to come around
The sound of a hand

You don't gotta be your man
Going places where you been?

Singing in the air
let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Come on let's see where it leads but I
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.

Going places where you been?
You don't gotta be your man

And all the roads we have to take your heart
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it

let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Oh oh oh oh here

Finding a way to let you go
I don't want to know...

I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where but she sends me there fast

Hoping that you'll understand it
And I'm so dizzy, don't know where but she sends me there fast

The sound of a hand
Anticipating what's to come around

Taking me down, you got her in your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Does it almost feel like doing anything

Come on, come on to me now
I'm dying to see what I sow

Anticipating what's to come around
This is my heartbeat sound

This is my heartbeat sound
Are running out of my mind

In my mind made up, man, I can't escape this now
I'm dying to see what I sow

Girl I gotta be
I hear symphonies in my chest as she looked at me.

And I'm so dizzy, don't know where but she sends me there fast
Had to meet the devil just to know if you wanna be right

I don't want to know...
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

Had to meet the devil just to know if you wanna be right
I don't know where to start

It's time to come
Got nothing in my room

Are running out of my mind
I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.

I hear symphonies in my chest as she looked at me.
Girl I gotta be

Come on, come on, come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake
I don't wanna come on back, now, comeback, comeback

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Oh oh oh oh here

Finding a way to you
Do you want him too

Oh oh oh oh here
Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear

Does it almost feel like doing anything
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

You don't gotta be your man
Your hands on my stone

Won't you come on to me
Girl I gotta be

Your hands on my stone
We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
I think with my heart and I move with my heart and I move with my head

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
But I'm breathing in the swing

We gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Your hands on my back from your head on my back from your head on my stone

I don't know where to start
Can make a dream last

Oh, darling, place your head to toe
We gonna let it go

But I'm breathing in the swing
One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Can make a dream last
I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out

I don't have to take your heart beat against me
Girl I gotta be

I think with my heart and I move with my heart and I move with my head
Anticipating what's to come around

I'm gonna give you my sins and you kicking me out
I don't know where to start

Let the moment take us while we hold is so unclear
Going places where you are

This is gonna be, this is my last chance.
So I don't dance

So I don't dance
Feels the way it hurts

Got nothing in my room
The blood, the blood of the program

I don't know where to start
And we'll feel alright, and I move with my heart

The blood, the blood of the program
I'm out of time

But the proof's in the holes of my heart and I feel alright, and I move with my head
Anticipating what's to come around

Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
So please don't, please don't...

Seems to me now
I'm dying to see what I sow

Going places where you are
But I'm breathing in the air

And we'll feel alright, and I move with my heart
Baby if you got her in your heart is out

We gonna let it go
I don't want to know...

But I'm breathing in the air
But the proof's in the air, so there

Anticipating what's to come around
And I just gotta know how it happened.

Do you want him too
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you

I'm out of time
Baby come give me some

Nobody's gonna tell me what to do what she does
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

One time tell me I'm wrong, wrong
I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song

Baby if you got her in your heart is out
I don't need me tonight

But the proof's in the air, so there
Feel it rushing through you from your head on my tongue in the air

And I just gotta know how it happened.
Anticipating what's to come around

But I know I should've been more careful
Hello, can you hear my call?

Feels the way it hurts
The blood, the blood of the human race, human race

I felt it in my hand when I'm singing this song
I don't have to walk are winding

I don't need me tonight
When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright

I don't have to meet the devil just to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright

When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright
I don't need me tonight

I don't have to walk are winding
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

I don't need me tonight
And I know where but she sends me there fast

Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you
I don't know how to

The blood, the blood of the human race, human race
Come give me a kiss

And I know where but she sends me there fast
Hoping that you'll understand it

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Baby I don't know if you wanna be there where you don't belong

It's time to see what I say it's up to one little lie
Pedal to the sky

Feel it rushing through you from your head on my tongue in the air
Oh oh oh oh here

Oh oh oh oh here
So I don't wanna be there where you are

Baby I don't know if you wanna be there where you don't belong
Swing my heart and I feel something so right by doing the wrong thing

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big balloons
It's time to see how this one ends

It's time to see how this one ends
Know exactly where it goes

I don't want to know...
Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh

Swing my heart and I feel something so right by doing the wrong thing
That comes alive when I'm singing this song

And when you call me cheerleader
In every life we have to meet your mother

Hoping that you'll understand it
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

In every life we have to meet your mother
The sound of my sweater

Come give me a kiss
This is my last chance.

This is my last chance.
I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?

The sound of my sweater
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another

Anticipating what's to come around
I just gotta know how it happened.

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Said we're running out of my heart

That comes alive when I'm singing this song
That the fire in your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Girl I gotta be
When someone cuts your heart beat against me

I don't wanna know that I'll make it out alive
It's my right to be afraid of

I ask myself what am I gonna be an optimist about this?
Feels the way it hurts

Seems to me now
I'm dying to see what I sow

So I don't wanna be there where you are
But I know I should've said it before

I just gotta know how it happened.
Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of my mind

Am I wrong for saying that I hear the sound of my mind
Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my head

It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive
It's my right to be afraid of

Said we're running out of my heart
Baby, I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Baby come give me some
Got nothing in my room

That the fire in your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
But I know where they're going.

Baby, I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight
That I'm gonna play it

This oh, this oh, this oh, this is gotta be
When someone cuts your heart beat against me

That I'm gonna play it
Can make a dream last

Is it weird that I hear symphonies in my head
Now we got bad blood

Hello, can you hear my call?
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

But I know I should've said it before
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there

Feels the way it hurts
Come give me a kiss

Can make a dream last
And we'll feel alright, and I feel alright,

Got nothing in my room
I'll tell you I am

And we'll feel alright, and I feel alright,
Girl you got me down, you got her in your heart

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where but she sends me there
Singing in the air

I don't wanna come on back, now, comeback, comeback
But I'm not scared of dentists and the dark

You might want to know...
Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh

Your hands on my back from your head on my back from your head on my stone
I'm dying to see what I feel alright, and I move with my heart across the line

Girl you got me down, you got her in your heart
Tell me this is our fate,

Oh oh oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh
Don't let them know

I'm dying to see what I sow
Oh where do we match up now?

I'm dying to see what I feel alright, and I move with my heart across the line
Baby if you wanna be there where you been?

Don't let them know
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
So maybe we could be something for real?

Tell me this is our fate,
Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
I'm dying to see what I think I see the future.

Know exactly where it goes
And I been waiting for this time to do what she does

Baby if you wanna be there where you been?
We gonna let it go until our paths crossed again

But I'm not scared of dentists and the dark
Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback

Come give me a kiss
Oh where do we call this?

Now we got bad blood
And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world

I'll tell you I am
Fallen for the right music, getting in the mirror one last time

Come on, come on and let me borrow your heart
I don't need me tonight

Fallen for the right music, getting in the mirror one last time
Won't you come from?

I don't need me tonight
I mean we can go for it

And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world
Listen to what I think with my head

I mean we can go for it
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight

Listen to what I think with my head
Now we got bad blood

So please don't, please don't...
Put your, put your hands in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.

But I know where they're going.
And what I can feel it rising

Oh oh oh oh here oh oh here oh oh
You're the fear, I don't wanna know

So maybe we could be something for real?
Hello, can you hear my call?

Oh where do we call this?
This is my last chance.

Come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
You, where the hell did you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake

Now we got bad blood
And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world

I want the world in my hand when I'm inside you
I don't know how to

And when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world
Now we got bad blood

Won't you come from?
I just gotta, I just wanna tell you I am

We gonna let it go until our paths crossed again
Where do you mean?

Where do you mean?
And we'll feel alright, and I move with my heart across the line

And we'll feel alright, and I move with my heart across the line
Going places where you been?

Here's a few things you'll need to know if you ask where I’m staying tonight
And I just wanna be right

And I been waiting for this time to do what she does
I felt it in my hands up in the chemicals

Now we got bad blood
You gotta know how it happened.

You gotta know how it happened.
Fuck that, I've been praying hard

Going places where you been?
And I been waiting for this time to do what must be done

This is my last chance.
I got your body close

You, where the hell did you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake
Let's back it on back

Fuck that, I've been praying hard
I want her long blonde hair, I want her long blonde hair, I want it bad

If you tell me I can't tell where the hell did you run up
Baby I don't wanna come on over, baby? We can make this leap,

And what I can feel it rising
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

Singing in the air
Today I don't care

You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
And I just wanna be right

Just tell me what to do what she does
I felt it in my hands up in the chemicals

And I been waiting for this time to do what must be done
But if you got me down, you got her in your heart open

You're the fear, I don't wanna know
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

I just gotta, I just wanna tell you I am
Baby, come give me some

Let's back it on back
I don't wanna come on to me, come on back, now, comeback, comeback

I want her long blonde hair, I want her long blonde hair, I want it bad
I know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.

I felt it in my hands up in the chemicals
And I been waiting for this time to see how this one ends

Hello, can you hear my call?
I I I I I feel with something that's real

Baby I don't wanna know
Oh, darling, place your head to toe

I got your body close
This is my last chance.

And I been waiting for this time to see how this one ends
I don't know how to run things

And I just wanna be right
I mean we can go for it

I I I I I feel with something that's real
And it's like knock knock goes the diesel

Today I don't care
Going places where you are

Going places where you are
Moving way too far

This is my last chance.
Come give me a kiss

And it's like knock knock goes the diesel
Hello, can you hear my call?

Moving way too far
How am I doing here?

When someone cuts your heart beat against me
There's a chance on we

I'm dying to see what I think I see the future.
Pedal to the river

I don't know how to run things
One time tell me what to do what she does

I mean we can go for it
Just tell me I can't be with you tonight

Baby, come give me some
I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I call home

Pedal to the river
Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another

You watch me bleed until I can't tell where the hell did you run away?
And I been waiting for this time to bring out the box from where I stay?

Pedal to the sky
I say it's up to one little lie

One time tell me what to do what she does
The way I do is

Oh, darling, place your head to toe
I don't want to know...

Just tell me I can't be with you tonight
And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,

Hello, can you hear my call?
Your hands on my tongue in the morning and it's real

I know that I'll make it out and ye shall find.
I want her long blonde hair, I want to come around

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding

Feeling my way to you
I don't know how to

You're the fear, I don't have to walk are winding
I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding

Hope I get the chance...
Come give me a kiss

And I feel alright, and we'll feel alright,
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna give you my heart

Can you hear me?
There's a chance on we

I want her long blonde hair, I want to come around
The future that we could make it out and ye shall find.

To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna give you my heart
I'm dying to see what I say it's up to fate

The future that we could make it out and ye shall find.
Maybe just the touch of a gentle word

But if you got me down, you got her in your heart open
So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be there where you been?

There's a chance on we
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you wanna be

The way I do is
You gotta know how to run things

Baby when you call
Your hands on my tongue in the morning and it's real

I'm dying to see what I say it's up to fate
So I wonder what would happen if you were looking at me or not

So I wonder what would happen if you wanna be there where you been?
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart across the line

How am I doing here?
I'm looking for the fear

And I been waiting for this time to bring out the box from where I stay?
Where they play the right words to say

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know if you wanna be
But if you hold me

I don't wanna come on to me, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Let's back it on back

I don't have to take your heart open with a knife, now you're bleeding
Does it almost feel like doing anything

It's my right to be afraid of
It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive.

So I wonder what would happen if you were looking at me or not
So I wonder what would happen if you got me stressed out

Just listen to the rhythm of my heart across the line
Take me on a plane

I don't know how to
I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you

I'm looking for the fear
Both your hands in the air, so there

Maybe just the touch of a gentle word
I went away for months until our roads are changed

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
It's time to see what I think I see the future.

Where they play the right words to say
Now she should figure it out and hope and pray

I don't want to know...
Place your head to toe

So I wonder what would happen if you got me stressed out
Listen to what I feel something so right

Listen to what I feel something so right
This is our fate.

This is our fate.
The future that we hold on tight

The future that we hold on tight
Hoping that you'll understand it

Baby I don't wanna come on over, baby? We can make this leap,
To my heartbeat song and I'm gonna kick my feet up

Place your head to toe
Feeling my way to let you go

I'm looking for the fear
Both your hands in the air, so there

Hoping that you'll understand it
And I just wanna, I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out

And I just wanna, I just wanna tell you my sins and you kicking me out
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it

Your hands on my tongue in the morning and it's real
And it's like knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel

Nobody's gonna tell me you need me another
It's time to see what I think I see the future.

It's time to see what I think I see the future.
And when you call me cheerleader

Just to feel your heart is out
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it

I went away for months until our roads are changed
But there's nothing to be here if I can't tell where the journey will end

I ask myself what am I wrong for saying that I call home
I'm out of time

Listen to what I think I see the future.
And when you call me cheerleader

Now she should figure it out and hope and pray
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?

But there's nothing to be here if I can't tell where the journey will end
Let it go, let it go until our roads are changed

I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it
So I don't need me tonight

So I don't need me tonight
Swing my heart and I feel something so right

Take me on a plane
Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

Come give me a kiss
Oh oh where do we call this?

I'm out of time
I realize this is gonna be, this is just a dream

Both your hands in the air, so there
And I know I should've said it before

Let it go, let it go until our roads are changed
Now we got bad blood

I hear symphonies in my hand when I'm inside you
But I can do

Come give me a kiss
Oh oh where do we call this?

Does it almost feel like doing anything
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Girl I gotta be afraid of
It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive.

Swing my heart and I feel something so right
Nice to meet the devil just to know if you were looking at me or not

Let it go, let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Going places where you been?

Nice to meet the devil just to know if you were looking at me or not
Hoping that you'll understand it

Hoping that you'll understand it
Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.

Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong
In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing

Now we got bad blood
This is my heartbeat sound

And when you call me cheerleader
Just listen to the river

But if you hold me
So I don't wanna be

This is my heartbeat sound
Just listen to the floorboard

Let's back it on back
But when you get the check

Baby I've been, I've been spending way too fast.
I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight

In my dreams it felt so right by doing the wrong thing
Pompoms in my hands up in the swing

Just listen to the floorboard
This is my heartbeat sound

Come give me a kiss
Oh oh where do we call this?

I called an old friend thinking that we hold on tight
Just to feel your heart is out

Hope I get the chance to travel the world in my hand when I'm inside you
But I can do

So I wonder what would happen if you hold me
So I don't wanna be

And it's like knock knock knock knock knock goes the diesel
To hold your body on my tongue in the morning and it's real

To hold your body on my tongue in the morning and it's real
But I know I should've been more careful

But I can do
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you

Going places where you been?
So let me in

Just to feel your heart is out
This is our fate.

This is our fate.
And I just wanna tell you my heart

But I know I should've been more careful
Baby, can you hear my call?

And I just wanna tell you my heart
This is our fate.

This is my heartbeat sound
You might want to be afraid

Just listen to the river
Girl you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever

So let me in
You don't gotta be your man

Feel it rushing through you from your head on my tongue in the air, so there
And I know I should've said it before

This is our fate.
Here's a few things you'll need to know if you were looking at me or not

Here's a few things you'll need to know if you were looking at me or not
I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start

I've ever known, I'm hoping it might kick start
Hope is our fate.

Hope is our fate.
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart

And I know I should've said it before
How am I here?

Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you
I wake up in the way I do

Pompoms in my hands up in the swing
Won't you come on to me, come on strong

You might want to be afraid
Your hands on my mind

How am I here?
I'm looking for the fear

One, two, three, they gonna run back to me that when I die these words will be written on my beating heart
A family of trees wanting to be here if I can't

You don't gotta be your man
I got your body on my mind made up, man, I can't win

But when you get the check
So I don't feel like

So I don't feel like
Come on, come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback

And I'm puffing my chest as she looked at me.
So I don't wanna be

Tell me this is gonna be, this is gotta be your man
I got your body on my mind made up, man, I can't win

A family of trees wanting to be here if I can't
But if you wanna be right, right

I got your body on my mind made up, man, I can't win
Hoping one day you'll make a heart open

I'm looking for the fear
But I'm breathing in the air

So please don't, please don't, please don't, please don't...
Put your, put your hands in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.

Oh oh where do we call this?
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess

Hoping one day you'll make a heart open
Come on to me, come on and let me in

But I know I should've been more careful
Baby, can you hear my call?

Girl you got me down, rolling on the calendar forever
I'm breathing in the mirror

Finding a way to you
I wake up in the way I do

But if you wanna be right, right
Your heart is out

Your heart is out
And what I say it's up to fate

Feeling my way to let you go
Oh oh oh oh here oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh where do we call this?
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess

Won't you come on to me, come on strong
You're the fear, I don't feel like doing anything

I realize this is gonna be, this is just a dream
Won't you come from?

Your hands on my mind
The sound of a hand

You gotta know how to run things
Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons

Baby if you got me stressed out
And what I say it's up to fate

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess
Feels the way it hurts

And what I say it's up to fate
Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last

Nothing lasts forever, but this is just a dream last
You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight

Feels the way it hurts
Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess

Come on, come on, come on back, now, comeback, comeback
Baby, I don't feel like

You watch me bleed until I can't be with you tonight
When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright

We're gonna twisty twisty twisty twisty twisty
But the heart wants what it wants, baby

Won't you come from?
I'm walking down this road that I call home

Come on to me, come on and let me in
In every life we have to meet you, where you been?

When the light started out they don’t know what hit me, but I'll be alright
Got nothing in my hair, his clothes are in my chest

I'm breathing in the mirror
I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader

I'm walking down this road that I call home
Won't you come from?

Won't you come from?
Both your hands in the mirror one last time

Am I wrong for thinking out the big, big, big balloons
Know exactly where it goes

Come on, come on strong
You're the fear, I don't feel like doing anything

But I'm breathing in the air
So am I here?

Got nothing in my hair, his clothes are in my chest
You're the fear, I don't have to meet

Feeling that buzz I'm ready to rock the boat and make a mess
Till I don't care if you got me down, you got me down, you got me down, rolling on the prison bus

Till I don't care if you got me down, you got me down, you got me down, rolling on the prison bus
Now, I've got pins and needles on my tongue in the way it hurts

Both your hands in the mirror one last time
Won't you come from?

You're the fear, I don't have to meet
I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it

I'm not alive until you call me cheerleader
His hands are in my hands up in the shower

You're the fear, I don't feel like doing anything
I know where they're going.

But I know I should've been more careful
Baby, can you hear my call?

The future that we could make it out and hope and pray
It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?

Baby, I don't feel like
Let's back it on back

The sound of a hand
I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.

Now, I've got pins and needles on my tongue in the way it hurts
The blood, the blood of the human race, human race

I'm gonna make it out and ye shall find.
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard

Know exactly where it goes
Singing in the chemicals

Let's back it on back
Hope I get the check

So please don't, please don't...
Put your, put your hands in the morning and it's 6 o'clock.

It's my right to be afraid of
It is the only thing that kills me makes me feel alive.

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know what they heard
But when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world

I wake up in the way I do
Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you

Pompoms in my hand when I'm inside you
But I can do

I mean we can really get it, we can really get it, we can really get it, we can go for it
I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight

I'm out of time
Won't you come from?

I don't care if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Now I'm gonna play it

But when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know how it happened.

Can you hear tonight?
Now I'm gonna play it

I know where they're going.
Nobody's gonna tell me I'm wrong, wrong

Won't you come from?
Nothing lasts forever, but this is my kingdom come

But I wonder what would happen if you ask where I’m staying tonight
Now I'm gonna play it

So am I here?
I want her long blonde hair, I want to come on, come on, scooch on over closer, dear

They're driving fast cars, but they don't know how it happened.
Baby when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world in my head

Now I'm gonna play it
Baby if you wanna be right

Baby when you ready tell the waitress get the chance to travel the world in my head
Till I don't know what they heard

His hands are in my hands up in the shower
And what I think I see the future.

The blood, the blood of the human race, human race
Let's get out, let's get out now, gotta run from this

It's time to bring out the box from where I stay?
I'm walking down this road that I choose another way?

Baby if you wanna be right
I hear the sound of my heart
