Colors are everywhere around us!
Point to the ceiling
Point to the floor
Point to the window
Mother duck said
"Quack, quack, quack, quack."
One little duck
"Quack, quack, quack."
And eyes, and ears, and mouth,
And nose.
When you see something you want,
When you get something you want,
Say them every day
When someone helps you out,
Cares you know not, therefore sleep
The monkey chased the weasel
Pop! goes the weasel.
Every night when I get home
Take a stick and knock it off
Pop! goes the weasel. 
If that mockingbird won't sing,
If that billy goat won't pull,
If that cart and bull turn over,
If that dog named Rover won't bark,
If that horse and cart fall down,
Don't you remember, don't you know, 
If it hadn't a been for Cotton-eyed Joe! 
Hop, hop, hop - Hop, hop, hop
Teachers pet, is that you?
Brush Brush Brush Your Teeth,
Brush it every day!
Brush it every day! 
Shoes, shoes, it's time to wear your shoes
No, no, no, I don't like them, ew!
No, no, no, I don't want to wear the sunscreen
No, no, no, I don't like it, ew!
Bars, bars, why don't you climb the bars
Slide, slide, why don't you try the slide
No, no, no, I don't want to, ew!
Swings, swings, why don't you push the swings
No, no, no, I don't want to push the swings
Please, please, I want to swing with you
How old are you now? 
How old are you, Jack
How old are you now?
I'm wet through
He caused a lot of traffic jams wherever he would go
The ants were always getting mad and the beetles, 
they would fume
But Herb would always poke along and sing this little tune
Have patience, have patience
And think of all the times when others have to wait for you
He'd crash through every spider web and with crickets he'd collide
Some of you may find yourselves behind a creeping snail
So if you get impatient and you're easily disturbed
Ashes, ashes
Ashes, ashes 
who every day can turn another page.
One Brown Mouse sitting in a cage.
Which one of us exercises on the old treadmill
Who hides his head, pretending to sleep?
another page.
Your house is on fire.
Two little pumpkins pouting, pouting.
Two little pumpkins are grumpy.
Three little pumpkins yawning, yawning.
Put your things away.
Pick up your toys.
Pick up your shoes.
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me to love another
This old man, he plays one
He plays knick knack on my thumb
Give a dog a bone
This old man, he plays two
He plays knick knack on my shoe
This old man, he plays three
This old man, he plays four
This old man, he plays five
Don't play knick knack on that hive
This old man, he plays six
He plays knick knack on my sticks
This old man, he plays seven
This old man, he plays eight
This old man, he plays nine
This old man, he plays ten
He plays knick knack all over again
Clap your hands, clap your hands
Clap your hands everywhere
clap in front and clap behind
Let's do it again!
The little one stops to climb a tree
The little one stops to pick up sticks
The little one stops to check the time
The ants go marching ten by ten,
The little one stops to shut The End,
Open shut them, open shut them,
Creep them, crawl them, creep them, crawl them
Move them to your chin, chin, chin.
Open wide your little mouth,
There'd be Little Bo-Peep,
Who was always asleep!
When old Mother Goose
With the maids in a row.
If old Mother Goose
She'd stop and have lunch
When I get all steamed up
Here's an example of what I can do
I can turn my handle into a spout
Do you know the muffin man
Who lives on down the lane?
Who lives on down the lane.
Do you want to have a taste
Who lives on down the lane. 
This little piggy slid fast
This little piggy counted numbers
Little children are asking you
Who was sick, sick, sick,
Oh, mother dear,
You naughty kittens!
What! Soiled your mittens,
They washed their mittens,
What! Washed your mittens,
You're such good kittens.
But I smell a rat close by!
I smell a rat close by.
Can you wash your hair?
I can wash my hair.
Can you wash your feet?
I can wash my feet.
Can you wash your face?
I can wash my face.
Can you wash your knees?
I can wash my knees.
Can you wash your shoulders?
Can you wash your toes?
I can wash my toes.
Can you wash your hands?
I can wash my hands.
Can you wash your nose?
I can wash my nose.
Everywhere that Mary went
One little finger, one little finger, one little finger.
Point your finger up.
Point your finger down.
Put it on your head. Head!
Put it on your nose. Nose!
Put it on your chin. Chin!
Put it on your arm. Arm!
Put it on your leg. Leg!
Put it on your foot. Foot!
I like to eat, eat, eat apples and bananas.
A Yankee Doodle do or die
