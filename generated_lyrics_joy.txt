You bring my heart on fire, on fire
Baby you make it worth it, babe

Maybe it's all part of a palace within my dreams
Get it up in the darkness of my sweater
But I know that in the way to you

In the city that we could be
If you really wanna see the end as it begins
This is a blaze
Lighting me up so good that it hurts
Baby, now you're in my veins
Born in the way I feel it in daisy dukes
Slip on my feet
Na, na, na, na, na, na, that's my dog
Bring it one more trip around the moon

At the curtains of the way I treat her
Today is gonna be forever
You're the glitter in the air, the air

Little love, a little sweetness in my veins

Cold to the fella over there with all my friends

The next Friday night and we in the past!
Kept him warm in the morning now I see you

Our soundtrack's in the summer
And I can still get high with my baby, yeah
But with the wrist, boy
Look into your loving
Got in my bones

Lighting me up with all my friends

Sobering up we just sit on the wood make the world

The moon and the thread,
Get up, get em up, get em up, get up!
Bring it one more trip around the moon
Looking out for the rest of my life?
I love living in the way to you
Command me to come home
We be counting stars
Can I have your boots in it
You're gonna be the day
I can ride with my toes in the stereo
That one day I will be so proud of me
Night is young and sweet, only seventeen
It was a park of the way to serenade you
And the boys with the hella good hair
But I know that in the kitchen cooking pies
But I love to the good times
Born in the light of day
Our soundtrack's in the sin
We keep this love in a local rave
But I can see you and me
Dancing with my baby, yeah
Making momma so proud of my address,
I got 40 in the darkness of my world
I been Steph Curry with the wrist, boy
On the wind and sky
Get up, get em up
Cards on the ground
Dancing with my girls to the new kids
Kiss me under the light upon a hill
Cold to the refrigerator
The moon and the lights
And the boys with the wind and sky
I've always loved you for many years
Need a little loving tonight
And put on my boy, whatever
Dusty head lights dance with your name on it
When you worry call me, I make him buy me Balmain
Yeah, they're living the good time home to you
Our soundtrack's in the spot
The sun so hot and the truth collide
You make me hot like an icy blast
I've got an elastic heart,
You can be the one that saves me
With my guitar on the move like the break of dawn
Whatever you got everything,
Looking out for the rest of my world
For most of the Rolling Stone
Cards on the beach there with the beast inside
Making out on top of the cab
And I get high, and I can move mountains
Baby you make it worth it
Lighting me up with all my friends
But I can still get high with my toes in the past!
Could dress me up so good that it hurts
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na na
Ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
I got a perfect one
Our baby making bodies we just sit on the horizon
I'll be the best day of my love
I gave in to the new age
We keep this love in a nice dress,
And time is short.
And to the sky
In the lights are low
Bed, stay in it
We're living the good times
This is a blaze
Guess I love it
The moon and the truth collide
On the wind and sky
Need a little loving tonight
Yeah, they're living the life
Keep it reel to reel in the darkness of my life
The only heaven I'll be lounging on the ground
Lighting me up so good
The next Friday night and the girls so sweet
It's woven in my bed
And we'll be counting stars
Ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
When you worry call me, I make him buy me Balmain
And I can move mountains
Our time is frozen
Listen to the sky
I be in the air, the air
Yeah, you can run free
Yeah, you can take it up, up, up all night
Bound to get together,
Put your hands in the river the lessons I learned
For most of the waterfall.
Cold to the fire
I see you tomorrow
You take me over you're the magic from us soon
But I am one with the brown, skinny legs
At the curtains of the Rolling Stone
Na, na, na, na, na, that's my dog
I’m searching for a heart
So love me right
And I'll rise like the lease is up
Oh, baby, we found love in a tree museum
You can be the best day of my sweater
And you love me right
I'm waking up, I feel like an icy blast
Yeah, you can run free
Dancing with my baby
I knew we were bound to get together,
You got that good girl faith and a bottle of gin.
It's within my dreams
That you got on, baby, stay in bed
Just like a swinging vine,
We keep this love in my bed
Our soundtrack's in the movies
Baby you make it worth it, babe
When I met you in the darkness of my sweater
Listen to the refrigerator
It's within my dreams
Head in the sin
And she's doing it in my way
He's coming out on living room couches
It was a park of the Rolling Stone
Wait for me to be loved, loved, loved
The sun'll steal the magic in my bones
He's coming out on living room couches
And put on my own
He's coming out on living room couches
I'm gonna swing from the rest of my sweater
This love is a modern fairytale
Na na na na na na na na, na
Got an angel on my boy, whatever
Make time for me to come home
Baby you make me wait
Till the party and music and the girls so sweet
You take me over you're the magic from us soon
Let's hit the bando
I know you can run free
It's woven in my bed
I howled at the sunset, babe
Got in my bones, straight from Long Beach
You can see you
All hail the new age
We can take, we can break up outta here
Got a little loving tonight
Command me to be together,
A 70s dream and an elastic heart
We be counting stars
Standing in a tree museum
But I am one with the shot
And when we done, I make you smile?
We be counting stars
You can see the beautiful people
With my guitar on the cover of the Rolling Stone
It was a park of the Rolling Stone
Through the curtains of the Rolling Stone
The next Friday night and we in the light of day
Cards on the ground
But I can ride with my toes in the light of day
Know I love you when you're away, ooh, baby,
Just to get together.
Sobering up we just use for fun
I've got thick skin and an 80s best
You know she's in love with being queen.
In California with my baby
I’m searching for a heart
But I know that in the shower
Kiss me under the light upon a hill
Look into your loving
Starting right now I'll be your mister
And we found love in this town
Bound to get together,
Baby, now you're in my bones
You know she's in love with being queen.
And I can ride with my baby, yeah
Our time is frozen
I'll be the lesson
Starting right now I'll be your Clyde
And I can't wait till we close our eyes
And I can't wait till we can take it up, up, up
Can you feel like an angel on my own
So hot and the truth collide
I love to the fella over there with the shot
I knew we were bound to get together.
Better have your boots in it
This is gonna be forever
Ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Friday night and we in the sand
And she's doing it in my way
Let's get it on back
You're the light, you're the magic in my way
Welcome to the new kids
I've always loved you for many years

Bound to be together baby
You can dance, you can be the lesson
I need a little sympathy
But I know that in the movies

Little love, a little sweetness in my life
The sun'll steal the magic in my veins
In the lights are low
And put on my own
Yeah, you can set my heart to life
Let's give a toast to the music of the cab

Shot gun, aimed at my place and loves the underdog
Na na na na, na

And you love the game go good
If you really wanna see the end as it begins
Well, me—I fall in love with being queen.
Born in the light of day
Look into your loving arms
And put them in a nice dress,
Hippies, Queen of the waterfall.
Money on the couch
The sun'll steal the magic in my bones
The next Friday night and we in the movies
