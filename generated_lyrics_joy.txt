Laying right here dreaming in my hand, just a summertime strolling
We'll be raising our hands, shining up to the fella over there with the beast inside
Only you can run free
I'm waking up, I feel her love
Tell me that you love the colorful clothes she wears
Cold to the new age, to the DJ
I love living in the corner under clouds of marijuana
The next Friday night and we in the shade
So it's gonna be the day
And I get high, and I can make an explosion
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
And, baby, your smile's forever in my car and raced like a moth drawn to a flame
Bring it one more trip around the moon
I've been sat with you every single day
Better have your boots in it
Our time is frozen
All the way I feel her love
Future husband, better love me like you do
Bound to be together,
And now, we're ashes on the beach there with the shot
You make me hot like an icy blast
Like a disco ball around
Just to get low
This love is a modern fairytale
So you can run free
Could dress me up so good that it hurts
Music's on, I'm waking up, we fight the fire, then we burn it up in the clouds but my gravity's centered
I got whatever on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
We keep this love in a jar, she smiles and shakes it at me
Cards on the beach there with the beast inside
I'm doing everything I can see the world
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, that's my dog
When you worry call me, I make him buy me Balmain
Dancing with my baby
The past is in the darkness of my love
And it's killing me when you're singing that song and
Get it up in the darkness of my love
And I got a perfect one
When you worry you make it worth it
Well it's Saturday night and we in the studio, every night, late night
And now, we're ashes on the table, we're both showing hearts
So you can run free
Living in ruins of a thousand stars
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the darkness of my sweater
Yeah, I've got a dalmatian, and I love lying next to you
All hail the new age
And we found love in this town
Night is young and sweet, only seventeen
I love lying next to the fella over there with all your love, uh
Bound to be well
We can take, we can take, we can break up outta here
Baby, you make it double
We can take, we can take it up, up, up
You can see the beautiful people
He's coming out on living room couches
And, baby, your smile's forever in my bones, straight from inside
And put on my shoulder, and Mestopheles.
I been Steph Curry with the beast inside
Cause tonight is bottoms up
Hey, hey, until I made my mold different from the rest
I'm a soldier standing on my best suit
Today was gonna be forever
I can ride with my toes in the spring
I drive all night long
Sobering up we just use for fun
We can take, we can take it up, up, up
Get em up, get up!
Listen to the DJ
Cold to the fire
But I love living in the spot
Welcome to the DJ
You're gonna be the day
I'm left seeing red on my shoulder, and Mestopheles.
We be counting stars
I'm waking up, I feel like I'm standing with an army
Ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
Making out on top of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the night
I am one with the wrist, boy
That you got one
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But I've got fire for a kiss
We keep this love in my veins
Command me to be together,
Open doors for me to come home
Well, you done done me and you might get some kisses
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Cards on the horizon
Two kids, you and made you happy
Get em up, get up!
I be in the USA
I have your boots on
Deep in my bones, straight from Long Beach
This is a blaze
Our baby making bodies we just sit on the moon
Ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
I need a little mile-high flight attention
I got that good girl faith and a long night there
Today was gonna be forever
Said no more counting dollars, we'll be-we'll be counting up, watch how far them bands go
Everybody loves the way to serenade you
Whatever you got one
Day drunk into the ground
And to the refrigerator
We can take, we can take, we can take, we can break up outta here
And the boys with the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
Maybe we found love in a nice dress,
You're gonna be the teacher you can run free
Sobering up we just sit on the table, we're both showing hearts
Sobering up we just use for fun
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the river the lessons I learned
I been Steph Curry with the brown, skinny legs
Whatever you got one
She my trap queen, let her hit the switch and let our shadows dance
Money on the couch
I took two weeks vacation for the place to go
So it's gonna be the day
They, they gonna see us in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Hey, hey, until I made my mold different from the chandelier, from the chandelier
And come on, come on, girl, kick it on like Marvin Gaye
So let's take one more time, one more time, one more time, one more time
And I can see the beautiful people
Deep in my veins
Baby you make me wait
I'll be the lesson
And now, we're ashes on the cover of the Rolling Stone
Making out on top of the waterfall.
Na na na na na na na na
My prediction: Imma be on top of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
Cold to the sky
It's woven in my life
At least that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
Laying right here dreaming in my hand, just a summertime strolling
You can dance, you can start over, you can run free
The sun'll steal the magic in my car and raced like a swinging hot SPOT
When you worry call me, I make him buy me Balmain
We can take, we can take, we can take, we can break up outta here
Cards on the couch,
Dancing with my toes in the kitchen cooking pies
I howled at the sunset, babe
Sobering up we just use for fun
And then it's on, come on, come on, girl, kick it on like Marvin Gaye
Sunbathing on the cover of the cab
But I know you can start over you can go back, please enjoy your party
On and on and on and on and on
But all the time of your life
At the curtains of the tiger, a fighter, dancing through the air one time
Making momma so proud of my life
Shot gun, aimed at my place and loves the way to serenade you
All I want, all I need your loving, loving
It's within my dreams
Lighting me up with all my friends
Got a little sympathy
And she's doing it in my bones
But I've got an elastic heart,
I'll be the day
So love me right
I be in the darkness of my life
She my trap queen, let her hit the switch and let our shadows dance
I be in the sand
I be in the sin
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, that's my dog
So it's gonna be the day
I feel it in daisy dukes
Our soundtrack's in the spot
Yeah tonight is all about
But I know that in the studio, every night, late night
That one day I will nibble your ear
So the hearts keep breaking, and the girls so sweet
She my trap queen, let her hit the switch and let our shadows dance
And then it's on, come on back, that's my dog
Bright light living in the morning now I see this life like a jet
Our soundtrack's in the winter, left him frozen in the air, the air one time
With my guitar on the move like the lease is up
You make me wait
Know I love living in the way to you
Bring it one more time, one more trip around the moon
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide
Kiss me under the light upon a hill
I love you when you're away, ooh, baby,
At least that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
You make me hot like an angel
Hey soul sister, I’ll be your light, your match, your burning sun,
She my trap queen, let her hit the switch and let our shadows dance
Got in my veins
Na na na na, na
It's woven in my bones, straight from inside
I knew we were bound to get together.
Said all I need your loving, loving
Cause love comes slow and it feels like
And you love the colorful clothes she wears
That you got on, baby, stay in bed
Singing we found love in my soul
Well, I've got a perfect one
You're the glitter in the morning now I see this life like a brother, while he glows through the air into the ground
So you can start over you can set my heart on fire, on fire
Said all I need your loving, loving
Today is gonna be the perfect wife
Day drunk into the ground
For most of the Rolling Stone
Day drunk into the ground
I'm lightning on my own
All I need's a little loving tonight
Let's give a toast to the touch but she's warm as a devil
Standing in a photograph
In California with my baby, yeah
I shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off
Sobering up we just sit on the table, we're both showing hearts
Cold to the DJ
The only heaven I'll be here, somewhere in the sin
Bright light living in the kitchen cooking pies
I'm lightning on my side
Friday night and we in the corner under clouds of marijuana
At least that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
Sobering up we just use for fun
In the city that we could be
Na na na na, na
Needle and the truth collide
Sunbathing on the cover of the trailer park
Day drunk into the ground
At the curtains of the trailer park
And I'll write your name on it
Yeah, you can take it up, up, up all night
Tell me that you love the colorful clothes she wears
You make me hot like an angel on my feet
At least that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
Bright light living in the light upon a hill
Keep it reel to reel in the studio, every night, late night
Sobering up we just use for fun
Shot gun, aimed at my heart, you got on, baby, stay in bed
My acres of a plan
But I've got fire for a kiss
The sun'll steal the magic in my car and raced like a jet
So you can run free
We keep this love in my bones, straight from Long Beach
Making momma so proud of me
Baby, you make it worth it
And the boys with the beast inside
The next Friday night and we in the stereo
That one day I will be so proud of me
Baby girl, will you rock it out of the waterfall.
Cause love comes slow and it feels like
At least that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
Money on the couch
Yeah we got the eye of the discotheque
Boy, I adore you, I adore you, I adore you
But all the time of your life, yeah, oh yeah
Guess I love it
Cold to the new age, to the fella over there with the beast inside
If you really wanna see the sands on the wood make the game go good
I be in the past!
Dancing with my baby, yeah
It’s been a long night here, and a tight little skirt
See that girl, watch that scene, digging the Dancing Queen, young and the truth collide
Na, na, na, na, na, that's my dog
That one day I will nibble your ear
I got 40 in the darkness of my address,
Like a disco ball around
So it's gonna be the day
But I can move mountains
Born in the spot
Loves all of my sweater
But I love to the DJ
But I've got fire for a kiss
And it's killing me when you're singing that song and
Can I have your boots on
And the boys with the wind that lifts her perfume through the room
But I can see the sands on the wood make the game
I got 40 in the river the lessons I learned
On the wind and sky
All the way I feel the love
I be in the sand
And time is short.
I'm doing everything I can see you tomorrow
Hey, hey, until I made my mold different from the chandelier
Cold to the fella over there with the wind that lifts her perfume through the air into the night on
We keep this love in a local rave
At least that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
In California with my toes in the clouds but my gravity's centered
And put them in a nice dress,
Boy, I adore you, I adore you, I adore you, I adore you, I adore you, I adore you, I adore you
Stinging like a moth drawn to a better place
We be counting stars
I just wanna chill, got a blank space, baby
Standing in a photograph
You can be the teacher you can take our time, stay here
That one day I will nibble your ear
You're the light, you're the magic in my hand, just a summertime strolling
I be in the way to serenade you
So hot and the girls so sweet
Shot gun, aimed at my heart, you got on, baby, stay in it
And I get high, and I can move mountains
Now she's staying at my heart, you got one
Flashing lights spin around in circles till we can break up outta here
Na na na na, na

Money on the horizon
Need a little love in my bed
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
Dancing with my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a nice dress,
In the city that we could be together
My acres of a plan
360 with the beast inside
And when we done, I make you happy
And I'll rise like the lease is up
If you really wanna see the end as it begins
I need a little sympathy
And now, we're ashes on the table, we're both showing hearts
But I can move mountains
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
Our soundtrack's in the kitchen cooking pies with my girls to the good time home to you
Put your hands in the corner under clouds of marijuana
Look into your loving
I can see the sands on the moon with friends
Yeah, been on the moon with friends
But with the wrist, boy
And one thought crystallizes like an angel on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Na, na, na, na, na, that's my dog
You're the light, you're the magic in my veins
Welcome to the world
When you worry call me, I make him buy me Balmain
Looking out for the rest
Dancing with my baby walks over, drops a 20 in a couple of days
Music's on, I'm waking up, I feel
Day drunk into the ground

And when we done, I make you happy
Making momma so proud of my life
Dancing with my toes in the clouds but my gravity's centered
I got fire for a song tonight
Got a little sympathy
I knew we were bound to get together.
And a swinging vine,
Yeah, they're living the life
And she's doing it in my bones

Guess I love to get together,
Today is gonna be forever

And I can see the world
And I'll write your name on it
Yeah, you can be the one that saves me
Slip on my feet
I-I love the game
And you love the game go good
I'll be here, somewhere in the light of a plan
Sunbathing on the wood make the world you brought to life, to life yeah
All hail the new age
I know that in the darkness of my love
And you love me right
This love is a modern fairytale
Baby, bring a lemon and a long night here, and a bottle of gin.
And to the DJ
When you worry you make it worth it, babe
And you love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Sobering up we just use for fun
Like a disco ball around
God made my getaway
So the hearts keep breaking, and the girls so sweet
Bright light living in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar, ro-oar
Got a little sympathy
Shake it off, I shake it off, I shake it off
I-I love the game
Could dress me up so good that it hurts
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3 drink
And now, we're ashes on the move like the lease is up
Boy, I adore you, I adore you, I adore you, I adore you
And I got the fire, then we burn it up
And I get high, and I can ride with my toes in the way
But then you disappear and make me feel alive and brand new
Like a disco ball around
I've got an elastic heart,
If you really wanna see the sands on the ground
You got me singing in the clouds but my gravity's centered
You know she's in love with being queen.
Day drunk into the night was warm
You got me singing in the winter, left him frozen in the winter, left him frozen in the spring
Staring at the moon
I can see the beautiful people
Lighting me up so good that it hurts
We're living the good times
Our soundtrack's in the air, the air
Little love, a little love in a photograph
I howled at the sunset, babe
Money on the move like the break of dawn
My power flurries through the air one time
Deep in my car and raced like a moth drawn to a better place
Making out on top of the night
I be in the spot
I took two weeks vacation for the place to go
Head in the past!
But now you're in my mind and memory
On and on and on and on and on
So it's gonna be the best day of my address,
Make time for me and you bet I felt it
Bring it one more trip around the moon with friends
And we'll be counting stars
To keep the Goddess on my best suit
On the wind and sky
But with the wrist, boy
In the city that we love like a moth drawn to a flame
You can be the perfect wife
Baby, now you're in my bones, straight from inside
Keep it reel to reel in the studio, every night, late night
So hot and the girls so sweet
Tell me that you love the colorful clothes she wears
360 with the beast inside
Day drunk into the ground
At least that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
I be in the air
Loves all of my life?
And the boys with the wrist, boy
It's woven in my bones
Guess I love living in the studio, every night, late night
You make me wait
I feel the love, feel the love, feel the love
We can light it up, up, up, up
You got that good girl faith and a bottle of gin.
Say it makes you feel my love?
I've always loved you for many years
I need a little sweetness in my bones, straight from inside
Yeah, you can be the best day of my love
Na, na, na, na, na, that's my dog
Little love, a little love in a couple of days
Love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do, la-la-love me like you do
Looking out for the rest
I feel the love, feel the love, feel the love
Guess I love you more
With my guitar on the wood make the world
Lighting me up so good that it hurts
I know you can start over, you can go back, please enjoy your party
I knew we were bound to be loved, loved, loved, loved
Night is young and sweet, only seventeen
Cause love comes slow and it feels like
Right next to the fella over there with all your love, uh
Better have your boots in it
I howled at the sunset, babe
It was a park of the Rolling Stone
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the river the lessons I learned
But I know that in the summer
Is worth two lions, but here I am one with the brown, skinny legs
So love me right
When you worry call me, I make him buy me Balmain
She my trap queen, let her hit the switch and let our shadows dance
Making out on top of the Rolling Stone
All I want, all I want from you is to see you and me riding like Bonnie and Clyde
Ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh
I'll be the day
It's woven in my way
So you can be the teacher you can jive, having the time of your life, yeah, oh yeah
I'm left seeing red on my best suit
Yeah, you can run free
When you worry you make me feel good
You got a dalmatian, and I love you more
Let's get it on back
She my trap queen, let her hit the switch and let our shadows dance
Whatever you got everything,
Got a little loving tonight
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, that's my dog
So it's gonna be the day
I knew we were bound to get together,
And time is short.
Through the curtains of the trailer park
Bound to get up next to the DJ
And I get high, and I can still get high
I’m searching for a heart
In the lights are low
But all the time of your life, yeah, oh yeah
I have loved you and made you happy
On the wind and sky
Get up, get em up, get em up, get em up, get em up
Our soundtrack's in the kitchen cooking pies
Sobering up we just use for fun
Just to get together,

We be counting stars
Saturday night and the heads just roll
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break, break, break
Cold to the sky
Kiss me under the light of a palace within my reach
Bring it one more trip around the moon
In the city that we love like a bee I earned my stripes
Baby you make it worth it
We can light it up, up, up, up all night
I got whatever on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
This is a blaze
Kiss me under the light upon a hill
Money on the couch
But I love living in the summer
Well, I've got fire for a song tonight
Get up, get em up, get up!
I will be so proud
Command me to come home

And I got the eye of the world
My power flurries through the night on
Our baby making bodies we just sit on the moon
In the city that we love like a moth drawn to a better place

Can you feel like an angel on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Making momma so proud of my address,

Look into your loving arms

For most of the discotheque
