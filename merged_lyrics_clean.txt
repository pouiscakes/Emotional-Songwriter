Smiles await you when you rise

Round and round the cobbler's bench
The monkey chased the weasel
The monkey thought it was all in fun
Pop! goes the weasel.

A penny for a spool of thread
A penny for a needle
That's the way the money goes
Pop! goes the weasel.

Every night when I get home
The monkey's on the table
Take a stick and knock it off
Pop! goes the weasel.

There was a snail called Herbert who was so very slow
He caused a lot of traffic jams wherever he would go
The ants were always getting mad and the beetles, 
they would fume
But Herb would always poke along and sing this little tune


Have patience, have patience
Don't be in such a hurry
When you get impatient, you only start to worry
Remember, remember that God is patient, too
And think of all the times when others have to wait for you

When Herbert was much younger, he often got in trouble
Forgetting that he was a snail, he did things on the double
He'd crash through every spider web and with crickets he'd collide
'Til one day Herbert's father took his speeding son aside


As you can well imagine, there's a moral to this tale
Some of you may find yourselves behind a creeping snail
So if you get impatient and you're easily disturbed
Think about this little song and take a tip from Herb 
Ring around the rosy
Pocket full of posies
Ashes, ashes
We all fall down 

Ring around the rosy 
Pocket full of posies 
Ashes, ashes 
We all fall down  

Ring around the rosy 
Pocket full of posies 
Ashes, ashes 
We all fall down
Smile your little smile, take some tea with me awhile.
Brush away that black cloud from your shoulder.
Twitch your whiskers. Feel that you're really real.
Another tea-time, another day older.
ONE BROWN MOUSE
Jethro Tull

Puff warm breath on your tiny hands.
You wish you were a man
who every day can turn another page.
at my ever-open book
One Brown Mouse sitting in a cage.

Do you wonder if I really care for you
Am I just the company you keep
Which one of us exercises on the old treadmill
Who hides his head, pretending to sleep?

Smile your little smile, take some tea with me awhile.And every day 
we'll turn
another page.
at our ever-open book
One Brown Mouse sitting in a cage

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamt I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I hung my head, and I cried

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are grey
You never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

If you will only say the same
But if you leave me to love another
You'll regret it all one day

Oh, old Mother Goose
Had a house in the woods,
If you chanced to visit,
You'd see quite a brood!
There'd be Little Bo-Peep,
Looking after her sheep;
And the dear boy in blue
Who was always asleep!

When old Mother Goose
Wished to go for a ride,
She'd jump on her broomstick
And fly far and wide!
Up the beanstalk she'd go,
For the 'Golden Egg' show,
Then drop in to have tea
With the maids in a row.

If old Mother Goose
Was still out around noon,
She'd stop and have lunch
With the Man in the Moon.
For dessert they might try
Some of Jack Horner's pie,
And then off she would go,
With a quick wave 'Goodbye.'
And then off she would go,
With a quick wave 'Goodbye.'

Short and stouts
Here is my handle
Here is my spout
When I get all steamed up

Tip me over and pour me out

I can turn my handle into a spout
Tip me over and pour me out

This little piggy stayed home.
This little piggy had roast beef.
But this little piggy had none.
And this little piggy went
Wee, wee, wee
All the way home!

This little piggy kicked the football
This little piggy slid fast
This little piggy fell asleep
And this little piggy went
Wee, wee, wee
All the way home!

This little piggy drew some shapes
This little piggy dressed up
This little piggy counted numbers
And this little piggy read books
This little piggy went
Wee, wee, wee
All the way home!

London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down
London Bridge is falling down my fair lady.

Build it up with iron bars, iron bars, iron bars
Build it up with iron bars, my fair lady.

Iron bars will bend and bread, bend and break, bend and break,
Iron bars will bend and break, my fair lady.

Build it up with gold and silver, gold and silver, gold and silver,
Build it up with gold and silver my fair lady.

London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down
London Bridge is falling down my fair lady 
Little Miss Muffet
Sat on a tuffet,
Eating her curds and whey

Along came a spider
Who sat down beside her
And frightened Miss Muffet away.

Yankee Doodle went to town
Riding on a pony
He stuck a feather in his hat,
And called it macaroni.

Yankee Doodle keep it up,
Yankee Doodle dandy,
Mind the music and the step,
And have some tasty candy.

Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream

Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

Miss Polly had a dolly
Who was sick, sick, sick,
So she called for the doctor
To be quick, quick, quick;
The doctor came
With his bag and his hat,
And he knocked at the door
With a rat-a-tat-tat.

He looked at the dolly
And he shook his head,
And he said "Miss Polly,
Put her straight to bed."
He wrote out a paper
For a pill, pill, pill,
"That'll make her better,
Yes it will, will, will!"
Oh, rig-a-jig-jig and away we go,
Away we go, away we go
Rig-a-jig-jig and away we go,
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho

As I was walking down the street,
Down the street, down the street,
A girl who can twirl I chanced to meet
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho
A-rig-a-jig-jig and away we go,
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho

Bake me a cake as fast as you can
Prick it and pat it and mark it with a "b"
And put it in the oven for Billy and me

Bake me a cake as fast as you can
Mix it and stir it and bake it just right

And make pretty flowers here and there

Bake me a cake as fast as you can
Prick it and price it and mark it with a "b"
And put it in the oven for Billy and me
And put it in the oven for Billy and me

Three little kittens,
They lost their mittens,
And they began to cry,
Oh, mother dear,
We sadly fear
Our mittens we have lost.
What! Lost your mittens,
You naughty kittens!
Then you shall have no pie.
Mee-ow, mee-ow,
You shall have no pie.

The three little kittens,
They found their mittens,
And they began to cry,
Oh, mother dear,
See here, see here,
Our mittens we have found.

You darling kittens!
Then you shall have some pie.
Mee-ow, mee-ow,

The three little kittens,
Put on their mittens,
And soon ate up the pie;
Oh, mother dear,
We greatly fear
Our mittens we have soiled.
What! Soiled your mittens,
You naughty kittens!
Then they began to sigh,
Mee-ow, mee-ow,
They began to sigh.

The three little kittens,
They washed their mittens,
And hung them out to dry;
Oh mother dear,
Look here, look here,
Our mittens we have washed.
What! Washed your mittens,
You're such good kittens.
But I smell a rat close by!
Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush!
I smell a rat close by.

And one for my dame
And one for the little boy

Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go

He followed her to school one day
School one day, school one day
He followed her to school one day
Which was against the rule
It made the children laugh and play
Laugh and play, laugh and play
It made the children laugh and play
To see a lamb at school

And so the teacher turned him out
Turned him out, turned him out
And so the teacher turned him out
But still he lingered near
And waited patiently
Patiently, patiently
And wai-aited patiently
Til Mary did appear

Mary had a little lamb
Little lamb, little lamb
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go

I'm a Yankee Doodle dandy
A Yankee Doodle do or die
A real live nephew
Of my Uncle Sam's
Born on the Fourth of July
I've got a Yankee Doodle sweetheart
She's my Yankee Doodle joy

Yankee Doodle came to town
Just to ride the ponies
I am that Yankee Doodle boy
