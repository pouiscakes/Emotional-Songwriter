You can tell me why, why you do, ooh
No, I don't listen to

If you're gonna stay
If you wanna say

Let me take you long
But leave me hanging, hanging

No, I don't listen to
Don't you know you're trying to do

Give me all of me
Try to keep my head spinning, no kidding, I can't see

Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again
For the haters out there, you can let the light in

We work too damn hard for this just to give it up now and face the sun goes
With this boy who's hollering I can smell your scent from miles

Whistle past the breaking point
I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my feet

For the haters out there, you can let the light in
If I got all the tables turn

I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my feet
If it's wrong I don't plan to take over the planet

If I got all the tables turn
Somewhere with my people we can leave the night on

But leave me hanging, hanging
Don't have a little something

Every time that you take me high
When you don't want to want me to stay, oh why,

Maybe there's a way out of my blood
You know I won't be no one-night stand

Somewhere with my people we can leave the night on
You light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my cell phone

You know I won't be no one-night stand
I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,

If it's wrong I don't plan to take over the planet
We about to get what you want

Fight for yours and don't let them compare you, no
They tell me when it's burning low

You light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my cell phone
When you get stuck on

I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,
She is always right there when I need to make you understand

They tell me when it's burning low
And I let you go

Well, you can bite this
From your head yes

But I don't really know what I'm saying y'all
No, I'm just playing, I know when that hotline bling

With this boy who's hollering I can smell your scent from miles
Every time you are out them clothes

Don't keep it just one more time
Don't you know that I don't wanna steal your freedom

But something to smoke
Don't you know you're trying to get back

Every time you are out them clothes
Turning me on my apples

And people ask me how to dougie
We jumped never asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy

With this boy who's hollering I can make all the lights that light the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
Boys only want love if it's just in your

Don't you know you're trying to do
Never start no static I just can’t get over you

Turning me on my apples
If you wanna run away but your eyes

When you get stuck on
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
All I know people make promises all the right junk in all the tables turn

Go ahead and tell everybody what I'm supposed to heal it over time
Don't you know that I don't wanna steal your freedom

From your head yes
Don't have a little unimpressed with this

If you wanna say
She will go away

All I know people make promises all the right junk in all the tables turn
Time that you take my hand in my head above it as best I can.

She is always right there when I need to make you understand
It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you to leave, will you hold my hand?

That talk too much to say
She will go away

It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you to leave, will you hold my hand?
She's always right there when I need to make you understand

Time that you take my hand in my head above it as best I can.
They all know why I'm not insane

Don't you know you're trying to get back
You're over my head forever stuck

Don't have a little something
Let me take you long

Don't have a little unimpressed with this
The bruises on your lips

Yeah you can let the light when it's burning low
And I let you go

If you wanna run away but your eyes
Here I give you something that you are out them clothes

Why you always have to be the one I want to want me to chill
All that's left to do to me at all!

With what you say
She will go away

She will go away
Trying to reach the things that I can't have it any other way

Let me take you long
And this is my fight song

No, I'm just playing, I know when that hotline bling
And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no sleep, I guess that I never ask for every Sunday

You're over my head forever stuck
We about to get back

If you want to either
You pick me up when it's over

They all know why I'm not insane
You're over my head spinning, no kidding, I can't explain

We jumped never asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy
This is my destiny

You pick me up when it's over
Even if it's torture

And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no sleep, I guess that I never ask for every Sunday
You can tell everybody what I'm saying y'all

She's always right there when I need to make you understand
Omi make me kill one of the world,

Don't you know that I don't wanna steal your freedom
But I can make all the time

Here I give you something that you are out them clothes
Truth is that I could be like the cool kids.

And I let you go
For the haters out there, you can let the light when it's burning low

Finna give you up
Disappearing when you fall asleep

Truth is that I could be like the cool kids.
And I can't stop we're enemies

We about to get what you want
Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.

Don't you know you're trying to do
Never start no static I just can’t get over you

Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.
I need to complicate.

I need to complicate.
How many times do I have to be the outcast

How many times do I have to be the outcast
Turning me on my feet

Give me all of me
Try to keep my head spinning, no kidding, I can't see

The bruises on your lips
I took it right in my corner right there when I say I don't dance

Omi make me kill one of the world,
And if I seem uninterested

And if I seem uninterested
I don't plan to let you push me past the graveyard

Turning me on my feet
And I can’t get her off my chest

And I can’t get her off my chest
I wish that I can't sweep you off of your feet

And I can't stop we're enemies
Before the cool kids,

For the haters out there, you can let the light when it's burning low
I let you go

I took it right in my corner right there when I say I don't dance
And my kiss on your thighs like my fingerprints

This is my destiny
Don't keep it steady

I don't plan to let you push me past the graveyard
And if I seem uninterested

Don't it always seem to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
You're over my head spinning, no kidding, I can't explain

Even if it's torture
I hear your voice in my phone number

Before the cool kids,
We work too damn hard for this just to give it up now and face the sun goes

But I can make all the time
Over this music I don't wanna steal your freedom

And if I seem uninterested
You pick me up inside

I wish that I can't sweep you off of your feet
I can still hear you lie tonight

I let you go
Here I stand though

I hear your voice in my phone number
I wipe my brow and I don't want to either

I can still hear you lie tonight
No I won't hesitate

No I won't hesitate
I stay out too late if I'm honest

And my kiss on your thighs like my fingerprints
That's why I should never make a fuss

Disappearing when you fall asleep
Here I give you up

You pick me up inside
No, I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,

We work too damn hard for this just to give it up now and face the sun goes
And all the right places

You're over my head spinning, no kidding, I can't explain
When I say I don't want me to go through hell to prove I'm not insane

And this is my fight song
And I don't get along

That's why I should never make a fuss
And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no peace

Never start no static I just can’t get over you
And I don't listen to

We jumped never asking why I'm getting drunk on a couch
All I wanna touch

And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no peace
Then another one bites the dust settled around us

And I won't hesitate
I stay out too late if I'm honest

When you don't want to want me to stay, oh why,
Baby, why don't you let me stop by?

Then another one bites the dust settled around us
We about to get a little unimpressed with this

Don't keep it steady
Give your all to charity

No, I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,
They won't let this end

Just think while you've been getting down and keep it just one more time
Over this music I don't wanna steal your freedom

Trying to reach the things that I can't have it any other way
If you wanna say

All that's left to do to me at all!
Here I give you something that you sent me they're still living in a bubble

When I say I don't want me to go through hell to prove I'm not insane
You're the only thing I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the slow lane

I stay out too late if I'm honest
You see her when you say you need from it

They won't let this end
Call me on my feet is open wide

And I don't get along
Girl, you're the one thing, one thing

You're the only thing I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the slow lane
The pictures that you moan

Party girls don't get along
Girl, you're the one thing, one thing

The pictures that you moan
Put my finger on a plane

They won't let this end
Call me on my feet is open wide

Here I give you up
Disappearing when you fall asleep

Put my finger on a plane
No I won't ever let you under my skin

Boys only want love if it's just in your
I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the way the sunlight plays upon her hair

I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
You used to before

And all the right places
They say the words

How many times do I have to be with when the times get rough
Excuse me if I run it's not enough

We about to get back
Is you really fake

You can tell everybody what I'm saying y'all
You're never gonna be a homebody

And all the right places
They say the words

Well you see her when you leave me
Try to keep my head spinning, no kidding, I can't see

They say the words
Be the good times

But just give it up for you just say the words
Be the good times

No I won't ever let you under my skin
Cause I can't explain

We about to get a little unimpressed with this
Put my finger on your thighs like my fingerprints

Cause I can't explain
Don't it always seem to go home, we can leave the night on

Go ahead and tell everybody what I'm supposed to heal it over time
Over this music I don't wanna steal your freedom

Be the good times
And when the sun goes

If you wanna say
I wanna save that light the way

Just think while you've been getting down and keep it steady
Give your all to charity

And when the sun goes
Their skin in craters like the cool kids

Call me on my feet is open wide
Take all of the world,

Girl, you're the one thing, one thing
The bruises on your tongue

You see her when you say you need from it
Whistle past the breaking point

The bruises on your tongue
And all the right junk in all the lights that lead us there are blinding

Like a finger on a film with you
And I don't listen to

Put my finger on your thighs like my fingerprints
The bruises on your lips

Whistle past the breaking point
And we'll start a riot

Nobody cares how fast we go crashing down, we come back every time
Over this music I don't wanna steal your freedom

The bruises on your lips
Now another one bites the dust settled around us

Their skin in craters like the cool kids
Every time that you are out them clothes

Take all of the world,
Baby, why don't you tell me I'm too young to understand

Baby, why don't you tell me I'm too young to understand
Can you hear that sound

Disappearing when you fall asleep
I'm standoffish, don't want you to stop

Now another one bites the dust settled around us
With what you wanna dance,

I let you go
Here I stand though

Don't it always seem to go home, we can leave the night on
Don't you know that I could be like the moon

And all the right junk in all the lights that lead us there are blinding
I don't get along

I wanna save that light the way
Trying to get what you wanna say

Over this music I don't wanna get with you and sit on a couch
All I wanna touch

I wipe my brow and I don't want to either
So you can let the light when it's all over

Can you hear that sound
If you don't pay it, don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind

Here I stand though
They tell me when it's burning low

They tell me when it's burning low
Did you have to tell you about, no

If you don't pay it, don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
And his voice is too loud

Don't you know that I could be like the moon
Love me or hate me we just don't get angry at the fan

And his voice is too loud
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

Did you have to tell you about, no
They tell me when it's burning low

Love me or hate me we just don't get angry at the fan
We jumped never asking why I'm getting drunk on a loaded gun

Every time that you are out them clothes
Take another, I don't care if you close your eyes,

Trying to get what you wanna say
Give me all of this will go away

I hear your voice is too loud
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

Well, you can keep me
Try to keep my head spinning, no kidding, I can't see

I don't get along
Oh why can I say I don't want what you're offering

And I don't listen to
Then I'ma slow it back to you

We jumped never asking why I'm getting drunk on a loaded gun
Give me spots on my cell phone

Baby, why don't you let me stop by?
If you take me high

And we'll start a riot
When the lights that light

With what you wanna dance,
She's always in my pants

Maybe some part of you just for a second,
And if I seem uninterested

No matter what you need me
Try to keep my head spinning, no kidding, I can't see

And if I seem uninterested
And the next thing you know you're trying to get you out my mind

And the next thing you know you're trying to get you out my mind
They won't let this end

Disappearing when you say
Give me all of this will go away

You're never gonna be a homebody
You used to call me queen Bee

Give your all to charity
To pay off all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy

I'm standoffish, don't want me
Try to keep my head spinning, no kidding, I can't see

She's always in my pants
You wanna make a fuss

Disappearing when you fall asleep
I'm standoffish, don't want you to stop

Give me spots on my cell phone

If you take me high
They tell me to stay, oh why,

And all the time
Over this music I don't wanna steal your freedom

When the lights that light
Turning me on my feet is burning bright

They tell me to stay, oh why,
Cause I can't have it, I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my eye

Take another, I don't care if you close your eyes,
Every time you are out them clothes

Well you're the pain
I let you down

Every time you are out them clothes
You could've been getting down and keep it just to give it up now and face the sun goes

Turning me on my feet is burning bright
When I say I don't dance, don't ask, I don't plan to take over the planet

They won't let this end
Boys only want love if it's just pretend

I let you down
Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again

If you want to want me to stay, oh why,
Cause I can't have it, I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my eye

Whistle past the breaking point

Then I'ma slow it back to you
They tell me why, why you do, ooh

Boys only want love if it's just pretend
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted

I don't wanna get you out them clothes
You could've been getting down and keep it just to give it up now and face the sun goes

Is you really fake
Gotta get you drunk

To pay off all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy

I can still hear you lie tonight
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry if I stay out too late

I'd rather put on a loaded gun
There's no need to move, I need motivation, my one solution

We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted
From you hear that sound

No matter what you say you need me
Try to keep my head spinning, no kidding, I can't see

Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry if I stay out too late
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it

From you hear that sound
Every time that you are not around

Say whatever what you need me
Try to keep my head spinning, no kidding, I can't see

Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
Backin up a parking lot

There's no need to move, I need motivation, my one solution
And all the tables turn

Take another, I don't want what you're offering
And I won't stop moving

You wanna make a fuss
No, I don't dance

And all the tables turn
Did you have to cross that line

I'm standoffish, don't want you to stop
No, I don't mind if there's not much to ask for help

Did you have to cross that line
And when it rains and pours, and then you're gone

And when it rains and pours, and then you're gone
I get drunk on a loaded gun

You could've been getting down and keep it just to give it up now and face the sun goes
Try to keep my head girl writing the lines

I get drunk on a loaded gun
Truth is that you moan?

Every time that you are not around
Put your money where your mouth still remember the taste of my mind

Give me all of you just say the shoe can always fit, no matter what you say

They tell me why, why you do, ooh
When it rains you get jealous too

No, girl I'm not around
Now that you take my hand

When it rains you get jealous too

Can't stop, won't stop until you pull too hard,

Can't stop, won't stop until you pull too hard,
When you're living in my head

You can be the one I want to either
Maybe one of these days you can tell me when it's over

I'd rather put on a film with you on my cell phone

Don't you know you're trying to get back
But something to smoke

Don't keep it just one more time
Written in these walls are the one who takes you home

Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.
Take another, I don't deserve it

I don't care if you close your eyes
All hail the underdogs

With what you say you need me
But I can't see?

Take another, I don't deserve it
Can you hear my voice, you hear my voice it's no secret

Maybe one of these days you can tell me when it's over
Finna give you my lover

Try to keep my head for you
So you can tell me why, why you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, ooh

They tell me to stay, oh why,
Cause I can't have it, I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my eye

This is the part when I need to move, I need to be with when the world don't orbit around you?
So you can tell me why, why you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, ooh

I ain't tryna do what you want to be nice
Let me tell y'all a little unimpressed with this

Boys only want love if it's just in your
So you don't pay it no more

Finna give you my lover
You are the one I want to either

We'll find a reason why
Cause I can't have it, I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my eye

All I wanna save that light the way

Open up your mind
They won't let this end

Now that you sent me they're still living in my head girl writing the lines
And all the right places

And all the right places

Never start no static I just wanna get with you and sit on a film with you on my cell phone
You can call me on

Just think while you've been getting down and keep it just one more time
Written in these walls are the one who takes you home

Now another one bites the dust settled around us
Would you wanna dance,

All I know people make promises all the lights fade out
Leave me a minute

I just wanna get with you
So you can tell me why, why you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, ooh

Put your money where your mouth still remember the taste of my head for you
So you can tell me why, why you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, ooh

You're over my head for you just for a second,

You can call me on
Now that you moan?

I wish I had to go home, we can leave the night on
Now that you moan?

Now that you moan?
But I don't have to cross that line

I can't sweep you off of your money, give it all to me at all!
Here I give you something that you sent me they're still living in a bubble

Leave me a minute
Your intentions aren't to bother you but

But something to smoke
With this boy who's hollering I can hear is music from the back

And I let you go
We don't have to tell you about, no

Your intentions aren't to bother you but
Excuse me if I stay out too late

Like a finger on your tongue
And if you do, do me wrong

I can't have it, I can't stop we're enemies
But leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the good times

You're over my head for you just for a second,
No, please don't wake me up inside

I wanna do is just for a second,
No, please don't wake me up inside

That's why I should give you my lover
You are the one I want to either

But leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the good times
Written on these walls are the stories that I could be like the cool kids

For trying to be with when the world don't orbit around you?
When it rains you get jealous too

Written on these walls are the stories that I could be like the cool kids
We don't have any plans

Would you wanna dance,
And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no peace

But I don't have to cross that line
Be the good girl you always have to go home, we can leave the night on

We don't have any plans
Will your mouth is

And if you do, do me wrong
I wanna save that light the way are blinding

Will your mouth is
Before the cool kids.

Before the cool kids.
Will your mouth is

No, please don't wake me up inside
There's a million reasons why I should give you all of you just for a second,

Excuse me if I stay out too late
No I won't hesitate

Be the good girl you always have to go home, we can leave the night on
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no peace
She's always in my pants

No I won't hesitate
Now that you won't forget

She's always in my pants
Enough to make the pickups

All I wanna save that light the way
If you wanna say

Written in these walls are the stories that I wouldn't wanna tell you
When it rains you get jealous too

You are the one I want to either
Even if it's torture

But I can't see?
So wake me up and play me

Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
Every time that you moan?

So wake me up and play me
And I can't see?

If you wanna say
I wanna save that light the way

And all the time
Written in these walls are the one who takes you home

There's a million reasons why I should give you all of you just for a second,
Why you always have to tell you to leave, will you hold my hand?

Tell me to go
We don't have to tell you about, no

Oh darling, I just wanna get you out of my head, get you out of my head for you
When it rains you get jealous too

Even if it's torture
Nothing that I could scream forever

Take all of me
And I can't see?

Every time that you moan?
Maybe some part of you just for me to pop the question

Enough to make the pickups
All that's left to do this, you leave no choice

Before the cool kids,
Will your mouth is

Boys only want love if it's just in your
So you don't pay it no more

Now that you won't forget
And I don't plan to take over the planet

Why you always have to tell you to leave, will you hold my hand?
And I won't be no one-night stand

All that's left to do this, you leave no choice
For trying to be nice

I wanna save that light the way
You are the one I want to say

Maybe some part of you just for me to pop the question
Like a finger on a film with you and sit on a loaded gun

I wanna save that light the way are blinding
So you can do what everybody else doing

No, I don't mind if there's not much to ask for help
I ain't tryna do what you want it to stop

You are the one I want to say
She will go away

When it rains you get jealous too
I get drunk on a film with you

So you can do what everybody else doing
And the way are blinding

I get drunk on a film with you
You pick me up and try to run away too?

For trying to be nice
Well, you can bite this

And I won't be no one-night stand
Baby, why don't you tell me I'm too young to understand

Baby, why don't you tell me I'm too young to understand
They all know why I'm not around

So you don't pay it no more
Got to find a road with no name, lay back in the way the sunlight plays upon her hair

And I don't plan to take over the planet
You pick me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust

If you wanna say
She will go away

Before the cool kids,
Will your mouth is

Like a finger on a film with you and sit on a loaded gun
I'd do anything with you on my cell phone

I hate to do is be with when the world don't orbit around you?
You pick me up and try to run away too?

We don't have to tell you about, no
When you nod your head to toe

She will go away
All I wanna save that light the way

Well, you can bite this
Light me up that cigarette and I don't need no one else

Light me up that cigarette and I don't need no one else

If you wanna say

There's no need to fight
This is the part when I need to move, I need to complicate.

But something to drink and maybe something to drink and maybe something to smoke

And his voice is too loud
Can you hear that sound

Don't keep it steady
Unless you show me how to treat me like a lady

And all the right places
So, all hail the outlaws

Cause I can't have it, I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my eye

And the haters out there, you can do what everybody else doing
You can tell everybody what I'm saying

You know I won't fill your mind
I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,

I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,
I can't take it no mind, mind, mind

Be the good times
And when the sun goes

All that's left to do is be with when the sun
With this boy who's hollering I can make all the tables turn

I don't really know what I'm supposed to do this, you leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the GOAT's for it
I don't need to complicate.

And when the sun goes
That I'm all these people listen to and I don't wanna steal your covers

No matter what you wanna do

Trying to get what you decide

You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't have it any other way
Baby, I just wanna take your breath away

That I'm all these people listen to and I don't wanna steal your covers
Makes you wanna run away but your eyes

Well, you can do what everybody else doing
And is it too much and wanna stay too long

You hear my voice, you hear my voice this time?
When I say I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna steal your freedom

Trying to get you out of my love?
If I'm a pagan of the cage where you live

I used to call me queen Bee
If you're gonna, if you're coming my way, just don't

If you want call me like a lady
You can tell everybody

You light me up and play me
And I can't see

Like a finger on a film with you
For trying to do

Makes you wanna run away but your eyes
Truth is that I can't get you out them clothes

Don't you know that this is supposed to match
I'd do anything with you and sit on a couch

Baby, I just wanna take your breath away
If you wanna say

Yeah you can bite this
I wish that I don't dance

And is it too much and wanna stay too long
And the way are blinding

Excuse me if I may just take your time with the call,

I took it right in my corner right there when I say I don't care if you close your eyes,
Truth is that I can't get you out them clothes

Someday when you close your eyes,
Truth is that I can't get you out them clothes

You stuck in my head for you
For trying to do

Trying to get what you decide
So wake me up inside

With this boy who's hollering I can make all the tables turn
She's always right there when I need motivation, my one solution

We about to get back
But your voice in my head forever stuck

Trying to reach the things that I could be that guy to heal it over time
When I say I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna steal your freedom

But I stand though
I wish I had to go

I wish I had to go
With this boy who's hollering I can still hear you making that money grow

Truth is that I can't get you out them clothes
For trying to do is be with when the sun goes

So wake me up inside
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,

When you don't pay it no more
How could every day something jumps in the way the sunlight plays upon her hair

I don't need to complicate.
And when you say you need from it

And when you say you need from it
My head's spinning around I can't sweep you off of your feet

And the way are blinding

I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
And his voice is too loud

I’m changing all of me
And I can't see

She's always right there when I need motivation, my one solution
When you get stuck on

No, I don't mind if there's not much to ask for help
And when you fall asleep

How could every day something jumps in the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I just wanna get with you anywhere

Touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like a lady
You can tell everybody

Enough to make a fuss
Don't have a little unimpressed with this

Yeah, no matter what you need me

Nothing that I could scream forever
But you tell me when it's over

Take another, I don't get along

For trying to do
When it rains you get jealous too

And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no sleep, I don’t get no peace
Would you wanna dance,

For trying to reach the things that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

Time that you take my hand

Just think while you've been getting down and keep it steady
Give your all to charity

With what you say you need me
You're the only thing I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the sea

Leave them burning and then it runs out
There's a million reasons why I should give you all of your feet

Time that you take my hand
You know I won't fill your mind

Like a finger on your thighs like my fingerprints
You're still in my pants

Take another, I don't get along
Like a finger on your tongue

Put my finger on a plane
Every time that you moan

Give your all to me at all!
Excuse me if I may just take your time with the call,

And all the right places
If he would have played it just to give it up now and face the sun goes

If he would have played it just to give it up now and face the sun goes
That I'm all these people listen to and I don't have any plans

That I'm all these people listen to and I don't have any plans
You're over my head girl writing the lines

With this boy who's hollering I can still hear you making that money grow
But I stand though

Every time that you moan
If I got you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

You know I won't fill your mind
They're making that sound

Like a finger on your tongue
Don't you know that this is my fight song

But I stand though
Doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh

You know I won't fill your mind
They're making that sound

They're making that sound
No, girl I'm not around

But your voice is a familiar sound,
No, girl I'm not around

Don't you know that this is my fight song
And I won't stop moving

But your voice in my head forever stuck
You're the colour of my head, get you drunk

You're over my head girl writing the lines
Maybe one of the good times

There's a million reasons why I should give you all of your feet
When you get undressed

Maybe one of the good times
You and me we will be boys

If I got you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
Every time that you get stuck on

Don't keep it steady
Give your all to charity

Give your all to charity
To pay off all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy

Doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh doh, doh doh
Why you always have to go

When you get undressed
Who can't live up to ash and dust

To pay off all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy
Give your all to charity

You're the only thing I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the sea
I don't want me

And I won't stop moving
I'm sorry if I seem a little something

You're still in my pants
When I need to move, I need to be nice

She will go away
That talk too much to say

Why you always have to go
Maybe one of these days you can let the light when it's burning low

No, girl I'm not around
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,

Every time that you get stuck on
Then stare at the tone

Who can't live up to ash and dust
This is my fault

This is my fault
I used to call me obsessed

That talk too much to say
Don't you know that I don't have to pay

I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,

This is my fault
I used to call me obsessed

When you get stuck on
Then stare at the tone

Then stare at the tone
Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again

This is my fault
I used to call me obsessed

Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again, play it again
You're the cure, you're the reason why my money's all gone

I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,

Lord knows I’ve tried, I can’t get you out of my love?
I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the mood to sit tight right where you live

I used to call me obsessed
Boy, when you're with me a minute

When it rains you get jealous too
And the next thing you know that I wouldn't wanna tell you

You and me we will be boys
So, all hail the outlaws

Boy, when you're with me a minute
Why you gotta know how to treat me like you do have me flying the highest

I'm sorry if I seem a little something
This woman is my fight song

Don't you know that I don't have to pay
Say whatever what you say

And the next thing you know that I wouldn't wanna tell you
You pick me up and try to run away too?

So you can let the light when it's over
Written on these walls are the one I want to either

This woman is my fight song
Party girls don't get along

You're the cure, you're the reason why my money's all gone
But I don't wanna get with you on my brain

With this boy who's hollering I can hear is music from the start, won't let go
Maybe one of these days you can let the light when it's burning low

But I don't wanna get with you on my brain
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I could be like the moon

Maybe one of these days you can let the light when it's burning low
Here I stand though

I don't want me
Cause I can't see?

That's why I never meant for you
You pick me up and try to run away too?

And never wants to sleep, I guess that I could be like the moon
Your touch, your skin locked in my head above it as best I can.

I don't care I'm a pagan of the world,
Say whatever what you decide

So, all hail the outlaws
Can you feel it? All that I don't care if you close your eyes,

If you're gonna, if you're coming my way, just don't
Don't have a little soirée

If you want it to stop
There's a million reasons why I never ask for help

I don't want me
Cause I can't see?

Then I'ma slow it back to you
You pick me up and try to run away too?

Party girls don't get along
Written on these walls are the one thing, one thing

Why you gotta know how to treat me like you do have me flying the highest
How many times do I have to be the outcast

But you tell me to stay, oh why,
If you take me high

You're the colour of my head, get you drunk
You've got my head forever stuck

Gotta get you drunk
You've got my head forever stuck

Say whatever what you say
I just wanna take your breath away

Your touch, your skin locked in my head above it as best I can.
The pictures that you moan?

How many times do I have to be the outcast
I know that I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my sleep at night

Say whatever what you decide
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to treat me like a rubber band until you pull too hard,

The pictures that you moan?
Then stare at the tone

Can you feel it? All that I don't care if you close your eyes,
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna steal your covers

Here I stand though
I’m changing all of this will go anywhere I go

I know that I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my sleep at night
You can call me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like it

Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to treat me like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
No, girl I'm not around

Written on these walls are the one thing, one thing
I don't get along

You pick me up and try to run away too?
I used to call me like you do, ooh

Then stare at the tone
If it's wrong I don't plan to let you under my skin

When I need to move, I need to be nice
Like a finger on your lips

Like a finger on your lips
You don't need to be nice

You can call me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, ta-ta-touch me like it
To tell you I'm straight

Truth is that I can hardly hear
I wish that I can't see clear no more

I’m changing all of this will go anywhere I go
You can tell me when it's burning low

Trying to get what you say
I just wanna take your breath away

I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna steal your covers
We don't have any plans

No, girl I'm not around
She's always right there when I need to make you understand

So what you say
I just wanna take your breath away

We don't have any plans
And the cops show up and try to run away but your eyes

To tell you I'm straight
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to treat me like you do have me flying the highest

You don't need to be nice
Now another one bites the dust settled around us

Written on these walls are the one I want to either
You pick me up when it's all over

If you want it to stop
There's a million reasons why I never ask for help

If it's wrong I don't plan to let you under my skin
The pictures that you moan

I just wanna take your breath away
Don't know if you're gonna stay

Don't know if you're gonna stay
Here I give you something that you sent me they're still living in my corner right there when I want to say

You're the cure, you're the reason why
If you take me high

You can tell me when it's burning low
Fight for yours and don't let them compare you, no

You've got my head forever stuck
I can't get you out of my head, get you drunk

So what you say you need me
Cause I can't see?

You pick me up when it's all over
Your touch, your skin locked in my phone number

Give your all to charity
That they're gonna throw it back down and keep it steady

Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to treat me like you do have me flying the highest
And this is my fault

I used to call me like you do, ooh
But I don't listen to

I don't get along
Let me take you long

Let me take you long
Don't you know that this is my fight song

You're the cure, you're the reason why
If you take me high

Then I'ma slow it back down and keep it just one more time
When I say I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna steal your freedom

Here I give you all of your skin
The pictures that you moan

Here I give you something that you sent me they're still living in my corner right there when I want to say
Don't know if you're gonna stay

And the cops show up and try to run away but your eyes
Their skin in craters like the cool kids, like the cool kids,

And this is my fault
I can still hear you lie tonight

When I say I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna steal your freedom
You are the one who takes you home

I can still hear you lie tonight
Leave them burning and then it runs out

That they're gonna throw it back down and keep it steady
Touch me like a lady

She's always right there when I need to make you understand
I remember the taste of my mind

Now another one bites the dust settled around us
Put your money where your mouth still remember the make-up running down your face

Fight for yours and don't let them compare you, no
But I stand though

The pictures that you moan
When you get stuck on

I remember the taste of my mind
When your legs don't work like they used to bite my tongue and hold my hand?

Ooh, I'd leave it all to me at all!
Excuse me if I may just take your time with the call,

Their skin in craters like the cool kids, like the cool kids,
Every time you are out them clothes

But I don't listen to
You're so indecisive of what I'm supposed to do is be with you

When your legs don't work like they used to bite my tongue and hold my hand?
Can you hear that sound

Cause I can't see?
I hate to do to me

I hate to do to me
If you're in the sea

Can you hear that sound
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

You're so indecisive of what I'm supposed to do is be with you
And I don't listen to

I hate to do is be with when the world don't orbit around you?
And I don't listen to

Put your money where your mouth still remember the make-up running down your face
So you can ring anybody's bell to get a little unimpressed with this

Leave them burning and then it runs out
You and me we just don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot

Every time you are out them clothes
Their skin in craters like the cool kids,

I can't get you out of my head, get you drunk
With this boy who's hollering I can hear is music from the back

You and me we just don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot
But I can't take it

Their skin in craters like the cool kids,
Be the good times

Don't you know that this is my fight song
So I won't stop moving

Maybe some part of you just for a second,
Well, you can let the light when it's all rusted

Don't know if you're gonna stay
Say whatever what you wanna say

Well, you can let the light when it's all rusted
We don't have to go through hell to prove I'm not wasted

You are the one who takes you home
When I say I don't wanna steal your freedom

When you get stuck on
When I need to move, I need motivation, my one solution

When I need to move, I need motivation, my one solution
If it's wrong I don't get angry at the fan

But I stand though
I let you go

And never wants to sleep, I guess that I could be like the cool kids,
Be the good times

We don't have to go through hell to prove I'm not wasted
Well, you can tell me when it's all rusted

There's a million reasons why I never ask for help
Written in these walls are the colors that I could wake up

If it's wrong I don't get angry at the fan
I'm waking up to what already done

If you take me high
To pay off all my friends keep asking why

Be the good times
And when you close your eyes,

Maybe there's a way out of my love?
I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the mood to sit tight right where you live

I'm waking up to what already done
My head's spinning around I can't get you out of my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down

To pay off all my friends keep asking why I'm not wasted
Well, you can tell me when it's all rusted

When I say I don't wanna steal your freedom
Trying to reach the things that I could be that guy to heal it over time

Touch me like a lady
Ooh, I'd leave it all to charity

So you can ring anybody's bell to get a little unimpressed with this
You don't need to be nice

But I can't take it
Time that you get undressed

Excuse me if I may just take your time with the call,
But just give it all to me at all!

And when you close your eyes,
But just give it up now and face the sun goes

Then all of me
If you're in the sea

I wish that I can't see clear no more
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the way the sunlight plays upon her hair

I'm waking up to what already done
My head's spinning around I can't get you out of my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down

Say whatever what you wanna say
Truth is that I can't make them stay

With this boy who's hollering I can hear is music from the back
But something to smoke

No, I just wanna get with you
And I don't listen to

But just give it up now and face the sun goes
Every time that you are out them clothes

Well, you can tell me when it's all rusted
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,

Time that you get undressed
Take another, I don't plan to take over the planet

I let you go
Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let go, don't let go, don't let go, don't let them compare you, no

You're so indecisive of what I'm supposed to say
Truth is that I can't make them stay

My head's spinning around I can't get you out of my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
I took it right in my head above it as best I can.

I took it right in my head above it as best I can.
And when it rains and pours, and then you're gone

Truth is that you get undressed
Take another, I don't plan to take over the planet

Take another, I don't plan to take over the planet
I stay out too late if I'm honest

Every time that you are out them clothes
You light me up and try to run away but your eyes

I stay out too late if I'm honest
You could've been getting down and keep it just to figure it out

I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
So what you trying to get what you want it, take it no mind, mind, mind

No, I'm just playing, I know they wind right back to you
And I don't listen to

So what you trying to get what you want it, take it no mind, mind, mind
Give me spots on my feet is open wide

Trying to reach the things that I could be that guy to heal it over time
Girl, you're the one who takes you home

You could've been getting down and keep it just to figure it out
This woman is my fault

This woman is my fault
Who can't live up to ash and dust

So I won't stop moving
And is it too much and wanna stay too long

Who can't live up to ash and dust
Take another, I don't listen to and I sweat my rust

Give me spots on my feet is open wide
Why don't you tell me when it's all rusted

If you're in the sea
Yeah, no matter what you say you need me

You light me up and try to run away but your eyes
Now I'm trying to reach the things that I could be like the cool kids,

I will always want you to fix yourself
So what are you gonna do when the times get rough

And I got all the time
Girl, you're the one who takes you home

If you wanna run away but your eyes
Now I'm trying to reach the things that I could be like the cool kids,

Now I'm trying to reach the things that I could be like the cool kids,
Then I'ma slow it back down and out about the stupid little things

And when it rains and pours, and then you're gone
They all know why I'm not insane

And is it too much and wanna stay too long
And people ask me how to treat me like you do, do me wrong

Yeah, no matter what you say you need me
She is always right there when I need to move, I need to be

Why don't you tell me when it's all rusted
I can't take it no mind, mind, mind

They all know why I'm not insane
Truth is that you get stuck on

You could've been getting down and keep it just one more time
Girl, you're the one who takes you home

Take all of you just hates me
She is always right there when I need to move, I need to be

I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
From you hear that sound

And people ask me how to treat me like you do, do me wrong
All my girls just keep on making the same thing.

We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
So you don't pay it, don't pay it, don't pay it, don't pay it no more

I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the mood to sit tight right where you live
Trying to get you out of my love?

From you hear that sound
Maybe there's a way out of my head

Take another, I don't listen to and I sweat my rust
Now that you won't forget

Then I'ma slow it back down and out about the stupid little things
And I don't care I'm a pagan of the stations

Ooh, I'd leave it all to charity
You act so naughty

But just give it all to me at all!
I just wanna take your time with the call,

And I don't care I'm a pagan of the stations
And I don't wanna get you out them clothes

Now that you won't forget
Leave them burning and then it runs out

You act so naughty
This is my destiny

And I don't wanna get you out them clothes
They say the words

Leave them burning and then it runs out
For the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate

So you don't pay it, don't pay it, don't pay it, don't pay it no more
All that's left to do is be with you anywhere

Truth is that I can't make them stay
She will go away

You hear my voice, you hear my voice this time?
Girl, you're the one who takes you home

I let you go
Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let go, don't let go, don't let go, don't let them compare you, no

To pay off all my friends keep asking why
Baby, why don't you let me stop by?

Then I'ma slow it back to you
And I don't listen to

Truth is that you get stuck on
Why you always have to cross that line

Say whatever what you need me
She is always right there when I need to move, I need to be

Let me tell y'all a little unimpressed with this
You don't need to be nice

But something to smoke
I took it right in my head forever stuck

She will go away
Say whatever what you say

From you hear my voice, you hear my voice this time?
Girl, you're the one who takes you home

For the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
This is my fault

I just wanna take your time with the call,
But just give it all

You don't need to be nice
And all the right junk in all the neighbors til the whole block hates us

Maybe there's a way out of my head
Oh darling, I just get it off my mind

Say whatever what you say
Did you have to pay

Fight for yours and don't let go, don't let go, don't let go, don't let go, don't let them compare you, no
If you gotta be so

All my girls just keep on making the same thing.
Walk, walk, don't look back, always do what everybody else doing

Written in these walls are the colors that I could wake up
Someday when you fall asleep

And all the right junk in all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
Yeah you can bite this

Your touch, your skin locked in my phone number
Yeah, no matter what you want to either

Why you always have to cross that line
Truth is that you moan?

Don't have a little soirée
You're never gonna be a homebody

This is my fault
There's no need to fight

Oh darling, I just get it off my mind
Be the good girl you always touching road

All that's left to do is be with you anywhere
If you're in the way the sunlight plays upon her hair

I hate to do to me
She is always right there when I need to move, I need to be

If you want it, take it no mind, mind, mind
Be the good girl you always touching road

Truth is that you moan?
Put my finger on a film with you and sit on a loaded gun

Did you have to pay

And I don't listen to

It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head

She will go anywhere I go and put this joint between your lips
Yeah you can bite this

They say that time's supposed to do to me at all!
You're on the wall

You're the cure, you're the reason why my money's all gone
Now I'm trying to reach the things that I could be like the cool kids, like the moon

She's always in my sleep at night
Who can't live up to ash and dust

Well you're the reason why my money's all gone
Now I'm trying to reach the things that I could be like the cool kids, like the moon

Let me take you long
My head's spinning around I can't compare to nothing

When you nod your head to toe
Don't wanna hear you making that money grow

No, I'm just playing, I know they wind right back to you
And I don't dance, don't ask, I don't listen to

But just give it all
You're on the wall

Yeah you can bite this
The bruises on your lips

Give me all of your money, give it all to me
You are the stories that I can't see

The bruises on your lips
Well, you can do what you wanna dance

Take only what you trying to be with when the times get rough
I'm sorry if I run it's not enough

Now I'm trying to reach the things that I could be like the cool kids, like the moon
I'm waking up to what already done

It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head
Truth is that I never meant for you to leave, will you hold my hand?

Who can't live up to ash and dust
Unless you show me how to treat me like it

Did you have to pay
If you just say the shoe can always fit, no matter what you say

Truth is that I never meant for you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Cause, I don't wanna blow your mind

My head's spinning around I can't compare to nothing
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining

You act so naughty
And people ask me how to dougie

Unless you show me how to treat me like it
I stay out too late if I'm honest

If you just say the shoe can always fit, no matter what you say
I’m changing all of this will go away

Well, you can do what you wanna dance
Then all of this will go anywhere I go and put this joint between your lips

Don't wanna hear you making that money grow
I'm gonna tell you about, no

I'm waking up to what already done
So tell my people we can leave the night on

You can find other fish in the mood to sit tight right where you live
How many things can I not conquer love?

I wish that I could scream forever
Even if it's torture

If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
So I won't stop moving

So I won't stop moving
Like a finger on your tongue

I'm gonna tell you about, no
If you gotta be so

I just wanna get with you anywhere
I wanna save that light the way the sunlight plays upon her hair

So tell my people we can leave the night on
And all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on a plane

And people ask me how to dougie
Touch me like a lady

When your legs don't work like they used to call me queen Bee
If you're gonna, if you're coming my way, just don't

Even if it's torture
We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone number

I stay out too late if I'm honest
Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.

And all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on a plane
You pick me up and try to shut us down

Like a finger on your tongue
But if you do, do me wrong

Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.
I wish that I can't take it

Would you wanna say
I’m changing all of this will go away

Cause, I don't wanna blow your mind
All I wanna do is just for a second,

If you gotta be so
When you nod your head to toe

I wish that I can't take it
Give me all of your feet

Give me all of your feet
She don't need to fight

She don't need to fight
I can still hear you lie tonight

Then all of this will go anywhere I go and put this joint between your lips
And when you leave no choice

All I wanna do is just for a second,
You pick me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet is open wide

But if you do, do me wrong
Maybe one of these days you can tell everybody what I'm saying

Maybe one of these days you can tell everybody what I'm saying
Why you gotta know how to treat me like you do, do me wrong

You light me up and try to run away but your eyes
That they're gonna throw it back down and out about the liars and the bees

And when you leave no choice
Enough to make the pickups

I can still hear you lie tonight
That I'm all these people listen to and I sweat my rust

You pick me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet is open wide
Over this music I don't wanna get you out of my head

I get drunk on a couch
All I wanna touch

Touch me like a lady
Don't you know that this is my destiny

Trumpets when you're with me
You are the stories that I can't see

If you're gonna, if you're coming my way, just don't
Don't have a little soirée

How many times do I have to be the one who takes you home
Take another, I don't wanna steal your freedom

That they're gonna throw it back down and out about the liars and the bees
I don't care if you close your eyes,

If you just hates me
You are the stories that I can't see

Over this music I don't wanna get you out of my head
And now I can’t get you out my mind

Enough to make the pickups
Let me tell y'all a little unimpressed with this

And now I can’t get you out my mind
And if I seem uninterested

I don't care if you close your eyes,
We don't have any plans

Is you really fake
Time that you sent me they're still living in my head forever stuck

Man, it's how them girls do it in the mood to sit tight right where you live
How many things can I not conquer love?

That I'm all these people listen to and I sweat my rust
Leave them burning and then it runs out

Say whatever what you want it all
You're on the wall

Let me tell y'all a little unimpressed with this
Don't you know you're trying to reach the things that I don't dance

Time that you sent me they're still living in my head forever stuck
No, I just wanna get you drunk

I get drunk on a couch
All I wanna touch

Don't have a little soirée
Don’t wanna be a homebody

Don't you know you're trying to reach the things that I don't dance
And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no sleep, I don’t get no sleep, I don’t get no peace

When you nod your head to toe
Baby tell me when it's burning low

And if I seem uninterested
Can you feel it? All that I can hear is music from the start, won't let this end

Leave them burning and then it runs out
And we'll start a riot

Even if it's torture
We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone number

Why you gotta know how to treat me like you do, do me wrong
But leave me hanging, hanging

And I don't dance, don't ask, I don't listen to
And the haters out there, you can do what you trying to do

And we'll start a riot
That they're gonna throw it back down and keep it just to figure it out

We don't have any plans
So, all hail the outlaws

I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
The feeling of your money, give it up for you to fix yourself

How many things can I not conquer love?
So you can tell me to move

You're on the wall
The world is beating loud, and she doesn't want it all

You pick me up and try to shut us down
When I need to move, I need motivation, my one solution

Don’t wanna be a homebody
I got you I'm sorry if I seem a little soirée

The world is beating loud, and she doesn't want it all
Tell me to chill

Trying to reach the things that I don't mind if there's not much to say

I'm waking up to what already done

I'm waking up to what already done
Well you're the pain

To tell you about, no
Maybe there's a way out of the good girl you always have to go

You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy
This is my destiny

Lord knows I’ve tried, I can’t get you out them clothes
Their skin in craters like the cool kids, like the cool kids.

Then I'ma slow it back to you
The pictures that you get jealous too

Is you really fake
You're on the sidewalk

Already brushing off the dust settled around us
Will your mouth still remember the make-up running down your face

The pictures that you get jealous too
And if you do, ooh

And the next thing you know I'm human too?
And if you do, ooh

Is you really real or is you really real or is you really real or is you really real or is you really real or is you really fake
You're on the sidewalk

Light me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust
No I won't hesitate

Their skin in craters like the cool kids, like the cool kids.
They say the words

And if you do, ooh
With this boy who's hollering I can shake it, like I'm supposed to do

They say the words
Will your mouth is

Will your mouth still remember the make-up running down your face
From your head yes

Why I should give you all of you just say the shoe can always fit, no matter what you trying to be
I don't want me

I can shake it, like I'm supposed to match
All I wanna touch

No I won't hesitate
And we'll start a riot

It's like we can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head
No, I don't mind

From you hear my voice, you hear my voice this time?
Man, I swear she's destined for the screen door slam

We don't have to pay
We about to get what you say

And we'll start a riot
You stuck in my sleep at night

Got to find a road with no name, lay back in the way are blinding
Why I should never make a point but you keep preaching

Say whatever what you wanna be no stick figure silicone Barbie doll
You're on the wall

Why I should never make a point but you keep preaching
I can't have it, I can't compare to nothing

No, I don't mind
You don't need a boyfriend

Will your mouth is
They say the words

Did you have to pay
We about to get what you say

But I don't mind
You don't need a boyfriend

From your head yes
All my girls just keep on making the same mistakes

We about to get what you say
All I know is that I can't have it, I can't make them stay

They say the words
If it's wrong I don't care if you close your eyes

This is my destiny
Why you gotta know how to dougie

I don't want me
If you want to be

If you want to be
If you just hates me

You stuck in my sleep at night
Do you need from it

They say that time's supposed to heal it over time
Man, I swear she's destined for the screen door slam

You don't need a boyfriend
They won't let this end

Maybe there's a way out of the good girl you always have to go
Baby tell me when it's burning low

Do you need from it
Time that you won't forget

I'm waking up to what already done
Well you're the pain

I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
The feeling of your money, give it up for you to fix yourself

You're on the wall
Give me all of your money, give it up for you just for me to chill

I can't have it, I can't compare to nothing
Take another, I don't want what you're offering

If it's wrong I don't care if you close your eyes
We don't have any plans

Take another, I don't want what you're offering
This woman is my fight song

But your voice in my eye
Why don't you tell me to stay, oh why,

We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone number
But you tell me when it's over

All I know is that I can't have it, I can't make them stay
We don't have to pay

Time that you won't forget
Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it

Man, I swear she's destined for the screen door slam
I can shake it, like I'm supposed to heal it over time

Well you're the pain
You are the colors that I can't explain

Why you gotta know how to dougie
And all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy

She don't need to be
If you just hates me

That's why I never ask for every Sunday
With what you want call me queen Bee

You're on the sidewalk
Is you really fake

Don't know if you're gonna stay
We don't have to pay

Can't stop, won't stop until you believe it
And I won't hesitate

But you tell me when it's over
Why I should give you my phone number

This woman is my fight song
I don't get along

With this boy who's hollering I can shake it, like I'm supposed to do
You can tell me why, why you do, ooh

They won't let this end
Light me up inside

And I won't hesitate
I know people make promises all the lights fade out

Is you really fake
But something to smoke

Light me up inside
Did you have to go through hell to prove I'm not around

Did you have to go through hell to prove I'm not around
If you're gonna be unsatisfied

All my girls just keep on making the same mistakes
Will your mouth still remember the make-up running down your face

We don't have any plans
Don't you know that this is supposed to do this, you leave me the birds and the bees

If you're gonna be unsatisfied
They're making that sound

Don't you know that this is supposed to do this, you leave me the birds and the bees
I can't stop we're enemies

You are the colors that I can't explain
This is the part when I need motivation, my one solution

But something to smoke
Put my finger on your thighs like my next mistake

This is the part when I need motivation, my one solution
And forget about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the good girl you always have to cross that line

You can tell me why, why you do, ooh
I'm standoffish, don't want you

I know people make promises all the lights fade out
I ain't tryna do what you want it, take it

I can shake it, like I'm supposed to heal it over time
I don't have to be the one who takes you home

And forget about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the good girl you always have to cross that line
And when it rains and pours, and then you're gone

Baby tell me when it's burning low
Don't wanna let you go

I can't stop we're enemies
They say the words

And when it rains and pours, and then you're gone
There's a million reasons why I never learn

There's a million reasons why I never learn
Girl, you're the pain

Go ahead and tell everybody what I'm supposed to match
All I wanna touch

They're making that sound
Take another, I don't have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted

All I wanna touch
Over this music I don't really know what I'm supposed to match

I ain't tryna do what you want it, take it
Time that you get undressed

We don't have to pay
Take only what you say

Don't wanna let you go
They tell me when it's burning low

They say the words
Be the good times

Why I should give you my phone number
And the haters out there, you can let the light when it's all over

Take another, I don't have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted
The pictures that you are not around

And the haters out there, you can let the light when it's all over
Even if it's torture

I don't get along
Let me take you long

And all my friends keep asking why I'm getting drunk on jealousy
You act so naughty

Maybe there's a way out of my love?
You can find other fish in the mood to sit tight right where you live

Even if it's torture
I took it right in my phone number

They say the words
Be the good times

Let me take you long
Don't know if you're coming my way, just don't get along

Be the good times
They say the words

Don't know if you're coming my way, just don't get along
But if you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, do me wrong

Will your mouth still remember the make-up running down your face
Swear it won't take you past our satellites

Baby tell me to go
They tell me when it's burning low

I'm standoffish, don't want you
You can call me like you do

Time that you get undressed
You pick me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust

They say the words
If you wanna run away but your eyes

If you just hates me
There's no need to be

No, I don't mean to bother me
There's no need to be

You stuck in my eye
Why don't you tell me to stay, oh why,

Girl, you're the pain
I'd rather put on a loaded gun

The pictures that you are not around
Baby, I just wanna get you out of the good girl you always touching road

Can you feel it? All that I could wake up
Someday when you fall asleep

Give me all of your money, give it up for you just for me to chill
We work too damn hard for this just to give it all to me at all!

We work too damn hard for this just to give it all to me at all!
Over this music I don't need a favor, who do they call?

They tell me when it's burning low
Give me all of this will go anywhere I go

If you wanna run away but your eyes
You could've been getting down and out about the stupid little things

Baby, I just wanna get you out of the good girl you always touching road
And his voice is too loud

You pick me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust
Now that you won't forget

You can call me like you do
With what you wanna run away too?

And his voice is too loud
But I woke up every time that you are not around

Now that you won't forget
Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.

With what you say you need me
There's no need to be

Put my finger on your thighs like my next mistake
Trying to get back

Just think while you've been getting down to this sick beat.
If it's wrong I don't plan to take over the planet

Take only what you say
If he would have played it just to kill today,

If it's wrong I don't plan to take over the planet
And we'll start a riot

And we'll start a riot
And this is my fault

And all the time

You could've been getting down and out about the stupid little things
We about to get you out them clothes

And this is my fault
And now I can’t get her off my chest

I don't have to be the one who takes you home

Here I give you something that you moan

You can find other fish in the mood to sit tight right where you live
If you just for me to move

Well you see her when you leave me the birds and the bees

If you take my hand in my pants
Oh why can I say to make a fuss

And I won't stop grooving
I never ask for every Sunday

I can't have it, I can't have it, I can't compare to nothing
Baby tell me why, why you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, do me wrong

This is my fault
Leave me a minute

Baby tell me why, why you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do, do me wrong
I need to make a point but you keep preaching

But just give it all to charity
And the next thing you know that this is my destiny

Take another, I don't dance, don't ask, I don't care if you do, do me wrong
I need to make a point but you keep preaching

Well you see her when you leave me the birds and the bees
And I got all the right places

All I wanna touch
Over this music I don't really know what I'm supposed to match

This is my fault
Leave me a minute

No, I don't wanna blow your mind
Enough to make you understand

Oh darling, I just get it off my mind
Enough to make you understand

Leave me a minute
I can make all the right junk in all the lights that light

I had some time just to give it time
If you want to be the one who takes you home

I can make all the right junk in all the lights that light
For the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate

I'ma speed it up for you to fix yourself
I wanna do is be with when the times get rough

For the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter what you want call me like a rubber band until you believe it

They say the shoe can always fit, no matter what you want call me like a rubber band until you believe it
Give me spots on my feet is burning bright

Oh why can I say to make a fuss
All my girls just keep on making the same mistakes

Give me spots on my feet is burning bright
And I won't hesitate

All my girls just keep on making the same mistakes
From your head yes

If you want it to stop
Well you see her when you wake up

To tell you about, no
I let you go

Enough to make you understand
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna change your mind

And I won't hesitate
Do you need from it

And I got all the right places
I wipe my brow and I don't wanna steal your covers

I don't dance, don't ask, I don't wanna change your mind
If you're gonna, if you're gonna be unsatisfied

I let you go
I don't need to make my system blow

From your head yes
And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no peace

Oh darling, I just get it off my mind
If you're gonna, if you're gonna be unsatisfied

Cause, I don't want me to pop the question
If you're in the slow lane

I wipe my brow and I don't wanna steal your covers
Their skin in craters like the cool kids

But just give it all
But I don't need a favor, who do they call?

I don't need to make my system blow
They tell me when it's burning low

Do you need from it
Don't you know that this is my fault

If you're in the slow lane
You can call me on

If you just hates me
Cause I can't see

If you're gonna, if you're gonna be unsatisfied
Nobody cares how fast we go crashing down, we come back every time that you are not around

Nobody cares how fast we go crashing down, we come back every time that you are not around
I wish that I can't take it no mind, mind, mind

I used to before
Baby, I just wanna get with you anywhere

Their skin in craters like the cool kids
Every time you are out them clothes

Give me all of me
Cause I can't see

With what you wanna say
I got you I'm sorry if I may just take your breath away

I got you I'm sorry if I may just take your breath away
If you wanna say

But I can't take it
Don't you know that this is my fault

I wanna do is be with when the times get rough
To tell you I'm sorry if I run it's not enough

Don't you know that this is my fault
Leave them burning and then it runs out

I just wanna take your breath away
If you wanna say

Leave them burning and then it runs out
The ground beneath my feet is burning bright

All I know is that I never meant for you
Makes you wanna do

No, girl I'm not around
I wish that I can't take it no mind, mind, mind

I wish that I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
She's always in my head

But you tell me when it's over
If you want to either

If you wanna say
She will go away

You can call me on
I give you something that you moan

I give you something that you moan
I'ma speed it up now and face the sun

I'ma speed it up now and face the sun
I just wanna get you out of my head above it as best I can.

They tell me when it's burning low
Over this music I don't plan to let you go

If you want to be the one who takes you home
Just think while you've been getting down and keep it just one more time

Every time you are out them clothes
Before the cool kids, like the cool kids,

I just wanna get you out of my head above it as best I can.
There's a million reasons why I never learn

Makes you wanna do
I hate to do is be with you

If you want it to stop
Well you see her when you wake up

There's a million reasons why I never learn
Nobody cares how fast we go crashing down, we come back every time that you moan?

The ground beneath my feet is burning bright
Who can't live up to ash and dust

Before the cool kids, like the cool kids,
Be the good times

We about to get what you wanna do
I hate to do is be with you

She's always in my head
Open up your mind

Nobody cares how fast we go crashing down, we come back every time that you moan?
He keep telling me to pop the question

But just give it all
But I don't need a favor, who do they call?

He keep telling me to pop the question
I'm waking up to what already done

Be the good times
And the cops show up and try to run away but your eyes

Don't you know you're trying to be the one I want to say
She will go away

I need to make a point but you keep preaching
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining

Just think while you've been getting down and keep it just one more time
You are the one who takes you home

But something to drink and maybe something to drink and maybe something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Is you really fake

If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
Over this music I don't want what you're offering

And the cops show up and try to run away but your eyes
Don't leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the stations

Over this music I don't want what you're offering
Love me or hate me we just don't get along

I hate to do is be with you
Can you feel it? All that I don't care if you do, ooh

I'm waking up to what already done
Well you're the pain

Can you feel it? All that I don't care if you do, ooh
You are the stories that I wouldn't wanna tell you

Well you're the pain
No, I'm just playing, I know people make promises all the tables turn

And the next thing you know that this is my destiny
You could've been getting down and keep it steady

No matter what you need me
Cause I can't see

No, I'm just playing, I know people make promises all the tables turn
I get drunk on a loaded gun

And never wants to sleep, I don’t get no peace
You look like my fingerprints

Who can't live up to ash and dust
But if you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do have me flying the highest

I get drunk on a loaded gun
Party girls don't get angry at the bills I have to cross that line

Party girls don't get angry at the bills I have to cross that line
No I won't ever let you down

Love me or hate me we just don't get along
But leave me hanging, hanging

But if you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do have me flying the highest
But I can still hear you lie tonight

But leave me hanging, hanging
Even when I'm leaving

Don't leave me the birds and the dirty, dirty cheats of the stations
Take another, I don't have any plans

You look like my fingerprints
Makes you wanna dance,

But I can still hear you lie tonight
Backin up a parking lot

If you want to either
You're still in my phone number

To pay off all my friends keep asking why
If you take me high

Makes you wanna dance,
Swear it won't take you past our satellites

Take another, I don't have any plans
You light me up and try to run away but your eyes

No I won't ever let you down
Take all of your skin

You could've been getting down and keep it steady
Touch me like a lady

Take all of your skin
I wish that I can't sleep with you on my cell phone

Open up your mind
Makes you wanna be no one-night stand

You light me up and try to run away but your eyes
So, all hail the outlaws

So, all hail the outlaws
Like the cool kids,

Makes you wanna be no one-night stand
They all know why I'm not wasted

But I don't need a favor, who do they call?
But I don't want to want me to chill

Even when I'm leaving
Take another, I don't need to be the one thing, one thing

For the haters out there, you can tell me why, why you do, ooh
You are the stories that I wouldn't wanna tell you

Swear it won't take you past our satellites
Already brushing off the dust settled around us

They all know why I'm not wasted
I hear your voice is too loud

I'm standoffish, don't want me
Cause I can't see

Touch me like a lady
Give your all to charity

I hear your voice is too loud
Never start no static I just wanna blow your mind

You're still in my phone number
Even if it's torture

I wish that I can't sleep with you on my cell phone
You can be the one I want to want me to pop the question

You can be the one I want to want me to pop the question
Don't wanna let you under my skin

Backin up a parking lot
And we'll start a riot

Give your all to charity
So you can tell everybody

Don't wanna let you under my skin
And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn

And we gonna let it burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone

I never meant for you just hates me
Cause I can't see

With what you need me
Cause I can't see

Over this music I don't plan to let you go
So you can let the light when it's burning low

Is you really fake
But something to smoke

Already brushing off the dust settled around us
There's no need to make the pickups

There's no need to make the pickups
Will your mouth still remember the make-up running down your face

Like the cool kids,
You could've been getting down and out about the stupid little things

We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone
Boy, when you're with me a sign

Will your mouth still remember the make-up running down your face
Swear it won't take you past our satellites

Never start no static I just wanna blow your mind
Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to leave, will you hold my hand?

You are the stories that I wouldn't wanna tell you
There's a million reasons why I should give you something that you get jealous too

She will go away
I can shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to say

Take another, I don't need to be the one thing, one thing
When you don't want what you're offering

And we'll start a riot
Take all of your feet

I can shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to say
You're the only thing I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the way

You could've been getting down and out about the stupid little things
Did you have to be with when the sun goes

But something to smoke
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake

Take all of your feet
Backin up a parking lot

Ain't no way I'm gonna tell you to leave, will you hold my hand?
Take another, I don't wanna change your mind

You're the only thing I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day something jumps in the way
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I can shake it, like I'm supposed to say

Don't wanna let you go
So you can let the light when it's burning low

And never wants to sleep, I guess that I can shake it, like I'm supposed to say
If you're gonna stay

Boy, when you're with me a sign
I give you something that you get stuck on

Well, you can keep me
Cause I can't see

To tell you I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
I'ma speed it up for you to fix yourself

Take another, I don't wanna change your mind
Can you hear my voice, you hear my voice, you hear that sound

Can you hear my voice, you hear my voice, you hear that sound
Every time that you take my hand

When you don't want what you're offering
Even when I'm leaving

Backin up a parking lot
This woman is my fault

There's a million reasons why I should give you something that you get jealous too
You can tell me why, why you do, ooh

You can tell me why, why you do, ooh
I don't care if you do, ta-ta-touch me like you do

Did you have to be with when the sun goes
And now I can’t get you out them clothes

If you're gonna stay
You are the stories that I can't have it any other way

This woman is my fault
She is always right there when I want to be the outcast

She is always right there when I want to be the outcast
Leave me a minute

And now I can’t get you out them clothes
We don't have any plans

I give you something that you get stuck on
And when the sun

And when the sun
Every time that you moan?

Every time that you moan?
When you get stuck on

Can you hear that sound
Every time that you take my hand
