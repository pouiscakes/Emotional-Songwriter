We'll wake up with amnesia
Take another, I don't wanna steal your freedom

We don't have any plans
Give me all of the stations

And if I stay out too late
We don't have to tell you I'm straight

And is it too much and wanna stay too long
And I don't get along

When you're living in my pants
Put my finger on your thighs like my fingerprints

But just give it all
And if I may just take your time with the call,

No, I just get it off my mind
Say whatever what you wanna be no one-night stand

To tell you I'm sorry if I stay out too late
We don't have to tell you I'm straight

Before the cool kids
They say the words

You can call me on my cell phone
But I woke up every time that you moan?

All that's left to do to me at all!
And if I may just take your time with the call,

All hail the underdogs
Well, I'll just keep on blowing up my phone number

Before the cool kids
They say the words

The pictures that you get jealous too
If it's wrong I don't listen to

Say whatever what you wanna be no one-night stand
Take another, I don't wanna blow your mind

I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
So what are you gonna do when the times get rough

Take another, I don't wanna blow your mind
They're making that sound

We'll wake up with amnesia
Take another, I don't wanna steal your freedom

They say the words
Like the cool kids,

So if I stay out too late if I'm honest
Who can't live up to ash and dust

They say the words
Like the cool kids,

They're making that sound
If you want it, take it no mind, mind, mind

If you're in the way
She will go away

If you want it, take it no mind, mind, mind
You don't need a boyfriend

Maybe there's a way out of my mind
You don't need a boyfriend

And I don't get along
This woman is my fight song

And we'll start a riot
Trumpets when you're with me a minute

And now I can’t get you out my mind
You don't need a boyfriend

I stay out too late if I'm honest
Who can't live up to ash and dust

To tell you to fix yourself
Now that you won't forget

Nothing that I can't see clear no more
You used to before

Who can't live up to ash and dust
I used to call me obsessed

I used to call me on my feet is burning bright
You don't need to fight

And if I seem a little something
So I won't stop moving

You don't need a boyfriend
I remember the taste of my mind

The ground beneath my feet is burning bright
You don't need to fight

So I won't stop moving
Even when I'm leaving

We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone
But I woke up every time that you moan?

Like the cool kids,
I’m changing all of you just say the words

I remember the taste of my mind
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

Try to keep my head I'm out of my mind
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

And if I seem uninterested
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted

I used to call me obsessed
I stay out too late if I'm honest

All hail the underdogs
Well, I'll just keep on blowing up my phone number

Excuse me if I run it's not enough
So what are you gonna do when the times get rough

Say what you want it, take it no more
You used to before

Cause, I don't mind
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

I'd rather put on a loaded gun
I'm waking up to what already done

I stay out too late if I'm honest
And I can’t get her off my chest

Put my finger on your thighs like my next mistake
Is you really fake

Now that you won't forget
You're over my head for you to fix yourself

But I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

But I woke up every time that you moan?
And I can't sleep with you on my cell phone

So if I stay out too late

Enough to make the pickups
While I go and put this joint between your lips

The pictures that you moan
And I can't sleep with you on my cell phone

And I won't stop until you pull too hard,
How we plan to let you push me past the graveyard

Whistle past the breaking point
Say what you want

So you can tell me when it's burning low
How many things can I say to make my system blow

This woman is my fight song
Let me take you long

But just give it up now and face the sun
Put my finger on a loaded gun

Even when I'm leaving
No I won't stop moving

Turning me on my brain
I'd do anything with you and sit on a plane

Give me all of the stations
We don't have any plans

Say whatever what you want it, take it no more
I used to before

Baby, I just get it off my mind
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,

Touch me like a lady
You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy

Don't wanna let you push me past the graveyard
Can't stop, won't stop until you pull too hard,

If you don't pay it no more
I used to before

When it rains you get undressed
Touch me like you do have me flying the highest

So you can let the light when it's burning low
There's no need to make my system blow

You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy
Touch me like a lady

I know is that you won't forget
I don't want you to fix yourself

We don't have any plans
Try to keep my head girl writing the lines

They tell me when it's burning low
There's no need to make my system blow

Give your all to charity
You act so naughty

Over this music I don't wanna steal your covers
All hail the underdogs

No I won't ever let you push me past the graveyard
Can't stop, won't stop until you pull too hard,

They say the words
Like the cool kids.

I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
Open up your mind

Already brushing off the dust settled around us
You wanna make a fuss

No I won't stop moving
Even when I'm leaving

Touch me like a lady
You can tell everybody

I'd do anything with you on my brain
I'd do anything with you and sit on a plane

I'd do anything with you and sit on a plane
I'd do anything with you on my brain

I used to before
But I can't have it, I can't see clear no more

And I won't hesitate
I hate to do is just for a second,

Open up your mind
You know I won't be no one-night stand

When the lights that light
There's no need to fight

Put my finger on a loaded gun
I'm waking up to what already done

You know I won't be no one-night stand
I hate to do is just for a second,

And I won't be no one-night stand
I hate to do is just for a second,

I hate to do is just for a second,
Open up your mind

There's no need to fight
But I can still hear you lie tonight

You can tell everybody
I'm like a lady

I'd do anything with you on my brain
Well you're the pain

Already brushing off the dust settled around us
You wanna make a fuss

Truth is that you won't forget
I don't want you to fix yourself

I'd do anything with you on my apples
Swear it won't take you past our satellites

And my kiss on your thighs like my fingerprints
Swear it won't take you past our satellites

And if I seem uninterested
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted

Open up your mind
I hate to do is just for a second,

You stuck in my head above it as best I can.
Nothing that I don't get angry at the fan

Even when I'm leaving
But I can't have it, I can't compare to nothing

And all the tables turn
That's why I never learn

We'll wake up with amnesia
Take another, I don't wanna steal your freedom

You wanna make a fuss
Already brushing off the dust settled around us

She will go away
Don't keep it just to kill today,

No, I'm just playing, I know is that you moan
You stuck in my phone

I hate to do is just for a second,
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,

But I can still hear you lie tonight
You stuck in my sleep at night

Give your all to charity
You act so naughty

I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
If you wanna be no one-night stand

Well you're the pain
Cause I can't explain

No I won't ever let you push me past the graveyard
Can't stop, won't stop until you pull too hard,

I give you something that you moan?
You stuck in my phone

And the cops show up and try to run away too?
And I don't listen to

You can tell everybody
I'm like a lady

Baby, why don't you tell me when it's over
I give you my lover

If you wanna be no one-night stand
No, girl I'm not around

No, girl I'm not around
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,

They say the words
Like the cool kids.

Now that you are not around
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,

And the next thing you know I'm human too?
And I don't listen to

So if I seem uninterested
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted

We jumped never asking why I'm not around
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,

Truth is that you won't forget
I don't want you to fix yourself

And if I seem uninterested
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted

So you can tell me when it's over
I give you my lover

You're on the wall
I just wanna take your time with the call,

I'm waking up to what already done
And when the sun

Cause I can't explain
Put my finger on a plane

Whistle past the breaking point
Say what you want

All I know that this is my destiny
I can't stop we're enemies

Light me up inside
No matter what you decide

But I can't have it, I can't see clear no more
I used to before

I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
No I won't be no one-night stand

You stuck in my phone
Then stare at the tone

I'm waking up to what already done
And when the sun

Give your all to charity
You act so naughty

I used to before
With what you want it, take it no more

Try to keep my head girl writing the lines
We don't have any plans

No, please don't wake me up when it's burning low
There's no need to make my system blow

Even when I'm leaving
But I can't have it, I can't compare to nothing

You stuck in my sleep at night
When the lights that light

Well, you can let the light when it's over
I give you my lover

Boy, when you're with me a sign
Why you always have to cross that line

Call me on my apples
Swear it won't take you past our satellites

But I can't have it, I can't compare to nothing
And I won't stop moving

I'm like a lady
You could've been getting down and keep it steady

And if I seem uninterested
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted

Truth is that I can't see?
If you're in the sea

You could've been getting down and keep it steady
I'm like a lady

With what you want it, take it no more
I used to before

Is you really fake
Put my finger on your thighs like my next mistake

You look like my fingerprints
Swear it won't take you past our satellites

You wanna make a fuss
Already brushing off the dust settled around us

Angels every time that you won't forget
I don't want you to fix yourself

I used to before
If you don't pay it no more

Put my finger on a plane
They all know why I'm not insane

If you're gonna be unsatisfied
But leave me hanging, hanging

Why you always have to cross that line
Boy, when you're with me a sign

Like the cool kids.
They say the words

Touch me like you do have me flying the highest
And I can’t get her off my chest

I just wanna take your breath away
Don't keep it just to kill today,

I'm like a lady
You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy

And I can’t get her off my chest
And I don't listen to and I sweat my rust

And I don't listen to and I sweat my rust
When it rains you get undressed

No matter what you decide
Light me up inside

You know I won't hesitate
This is the part when I need to complicate.

Swear it won't take you past our satellites
She's always in my pants

She's always in my pants
Like a finger on your thighs like my fingerprints

Is you really fake
Put my finger on your thighs like my next mistake

When it rains you get undressed
Who can't live up to ash and dust

I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my cell phone
Then stare at the tone

They're making that sound
No I won't be no one-night stand

No I won't be no one-night stand
Cause I can't take it no mind, mind, mind

They say the words
Before the cool kids,

You act so naughty
Give your all to charity

So if I seem uninterested
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted

And I got you I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
I hate to do is be with when the times get rough

You know I won't hesitate
This is the part when I need to complicate.

And we'll start a riot
Leave me a minute

That's why I never learn
We'll wake up all the tables turn

Who can't live up to ash and dust
When you get undressed

Touch me like a lady
You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy

When the lights that light
I took it right in my sleep at night

And I won't stop moving
But leave me hanging, hanging

Before the cool kids,
Maybe some part of you just say the words

I wish that I could wake up all the right places
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted

But leave me hanging, hanging
When I say to make a point but you keep preaching

When I say to make a point but you keep preaching
And if I seem a little something

If you don't pay it no more
Boys only want love if it's just in your

Leave me a minute
And we'll start a riot

She will go away
Don't keep it just to kill today,

I took it right in my sleep at night
The ground beneath my feet is burning bright

No I won't hesitate
This is the part when I need to complicate.

How we plan to let you push me past the graveyard
Can't stop, won't stop until you pull too hard,

Put my finger on your thighs like my next mistake
And I can't explain

Like a finger on your lips
When I say to make the pickups

Baby tell me when it's burning low
There's no need to make my system blow

You act so naughty
Give your all to charity

She will go away
Don't keep it just to kill today,

The bruises on your lips
When I say to make the pickups

Whistle past the breaking point
Say what you want

When you get undressed
I stay out too late if I'm honest

You've got my head girl writing the lines
We don't have any plans

Light me up inside
Maybe one of these days you can do what you decide

I don't want you to fix yourself
Time that you won't forget

They all know why I'm not insane
And I can't explain

Excuse me if I run it's not enough
I hate to do is be with when the times get rough

And if I seem a little something
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining

Finna give you something that you get undressed
I stay out too late if I'm honest

You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy
I'm like a lady

When I say to make the pickups
The bruises on your lips

Cause I can't see?
If you're in the sea

I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my cell phone
Then stare at the tone

I hate to do is be with when the times get rough
I'm sorry if I run it's not enough

Ain't no way I'm gonna marry her anyway
Don't keep it steady

So you can tell everybody
Don't keep it steady

If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
When I say to make a point but you keep preaching

When I say to make a point but you keep preaching
Someday when you leave me hanging, hanging

And I can't see?
If you're in the sea

Like a finger on your thighs like my next mistake
And I can't explain

Don't keep it steady
I'm like a lady

All hail the underdogs
I wipe my brow and I don't wanna steal your covers

No, girl I'm not insane
And I can't explain

Baby tell me when it's burning low
There's no need to make my system blow

And this is my fight song
You are the stories that I don't get along

I just wanna take your time with the call,
If he would have played it just to give it all

Can't stop, won't stop until you pull too hard,
So I won't ever let you push me past the graveyard

How many times do I have to cross that line
Boy, when you're with me a sign

Don't keep it steady
I'm like a lady

I took it right in my sleep at night
The ground beneath my feet is burning bright

This is the part when I need to complicate.
I stay out too late if I'm honest

The ground beneath my feet is burning bright
I can make all the lights that light

Give me spots on my cell phone
Then stare at the tone

Before the cool kids,
Maybe some part of you just say the words

I can make all the lights that light
Call me on my feet is burning bright

All hail the underdogs
I wipe my brow and I don't wanna steal your covers

Cause I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
For trying to do is just for a second,

All hail the underdogs
I wipe my brow and I don't wanna steal your covers

Someday when you leave me hanging, hanging
Don't know if you're gonna be unsatisfied

I'm like a lady

And all the right places
We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted

And we'll start a riot
Touch me like you do have me flying the highest

I'm gonna tell you I'm straight
So if I stay out too late

Maybe some part of you just say the words
Like the cool kids.

There's no need to make my system blow
Light me up when it's burning low

For trying to do is just for a second,
No, I just can’t get you out my mind

Then stare at the tone
The pictures that you moan

You are the stories that I don't get along
And this is my fight song

I give you something that you get undressed
I stay out too late if I'm honest

And I can't explain
Well you're the pain

So you can let the light when it's over
I give you my lover

So I won't ever let you push me past the graveyard
Can't stop, won't stop until you pull too hard,

Don't keep it steady
When I need to be with you anywhere

Already brushing off the dust settled around us
Enough to make a fuss

No, I just can’t get you out my mind
Now that you take my hand

You act so naughty
Give your all to charity

Maybe one of these days you can do what you decide
Light me up inside

When I need to be with you anywhere
Don't keep it steady

Don't keep it steady
But if you do, ta-ta-touch me like a lady

And this is my fight song
Light me up that cigarette and I don't get along

If you're in the sea
And I can't see

I stay out too late if I'm honest
Touch me like you do have me flying the highest

If he would have played it just to give it all
You're on the wall

Now that you take my hand
But your voice is a familiar sound,

And I can't see
If you're in the sea

Light me up that cigarette and I don't get along
But if you do, do me wrong

Light me up when it's burning low
When I say to make my system blow

But your voice is a familiar sound,
She don't need a boyfriend

I wipe my brow and I don't wanna steal your covers
I give you my lover

She don't need a boyfriend
I hear your voice is a familiar sound,

And when the sun
I'm waking up to what already done

I hear your voice is a familiar sound,
Take all of you just for a second,

Call me on my feet is burning bright
And I don't need to fight

The pictures that you moan
She's always in my phone

Touch me like you do have me flying the highest
And we'll start a riot

And we'll start a riot
Leave me a minute

But your voice in my pants
Like a finger on your thighs like my fingerprints

She will go away
Don't keep it just to kill today,

When I say to make my system blow
But you tell me when it's burning low

We don't have any plans
Try to keep my head girl writing the lines

I don't get along
But if you do, do me wrong

I'm waking up to what already done
I get drunk on a loaded gun

Don't know if you're gonna be unsatisfied
But leave me hanging, hanging

Take all of you just for a second,
We about to get you out my mind

So if I stay out too late
We don't have to tell you I'm straight

And I don't need to fight
I can still hear you lie tonight

But you tell me when it's burning low
There's no need to make my system blow

Well you're the pain
No, girl I'm not insane

Time that you won't forget

And I won't stop moving
And I don't want what you're offering

You pick me up when it's burning low
There's no need to make my system blow

But if you do, ta-ta-touch me like a lady
You could've been getting down and keep it steady

I can't have it, I can't see clear no more

We jumped never asking why I'm not wasted
We'll wake up all the right places

The pictures that you won't forget
I'ma speed it up for you to fix yourself

Then another one bites the dust settled around us
Enough to make a fuss

They tell me when it's burning low
There's no need to make my system blow

Like a finger on your thighs like my fingerprints
Swear it won't take you past our satellites

We about to get you out my mind
She don't need to make you understand

Maybe some part of you just say the words
Like the cool kids.

And I don't want what you're offering
Even when I'm leaving

Take only what you decide
Light me up inside

You can call me like a lady
You could've been getting down and keep it steady

You're on the wall
But just give it all

No I won't hesitate

No, girl I'm not insane
If you're in the slow lane

No I won't hesitate
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

Maybe there's a way out of my mind
You know I won't be no one-night stand

You know I won't be no one-night stand
You know I won't fill your mind

There's no need to fight
She's always in my sleep at night

You know I won't fill your mind
Every time that you take my hand

Can't stop, won't stop until you pull too hard,
Don't wanna let you push me past the graveyard

There's no need to fight

When it rains you get undressed
Who can't live up to ash and dust

No, I just can’t get her off my mind
Every time that you take my hand

The bruises on your lips
She don't need to make the pickups

But I woke up every time that you get undressed
Who can't live up to ash and dust

Omi make me kill one of the stations
We don't have any plans

Every time that you take my hand
Can you hear that sound

Who can't live up to ash and dust
When you get undressed

She will go away
Don't keep it just to kill today,

Can you hear that sound
They all know why I'm not around

Enough to make a fuss
Now another one bites the dust settled around us

If you're in the slow lane
I'd do anything with you and sit on a plane

I took it right in my head above it as best I can.
Nothing that I don't get angry at the fan

I'd do anything with you and sit on a plane
Girl, you're the pain

They all know why I'm not around
Never start no static I just wanna blow your mind

Never start no static I just wanna blow your mind
Can you hear that sound

No matter what you decide
You pick me up inside

You could've been getting down and keep it steady
You can call me like a lady

Now I'm trying to get a little something
So you can tell everybody what I'm saying

I get drunk on a loaded gun
I need to be with when the sun

Don't have a little something
So you can tell everybody what I'm saying

If you're gonna, if you're gonna be unsatisfied
But leave me hanging, hanging

So you can tell everybody what I'm saying
I got you I'm sorry if I seem a little something

You are the stories that I can't see clear no more
Boys only want love if it's just in your

Disappearing when you wake up with amnesia
Take another, I don't wanna steal your freedom

Can you hear that sound
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

Like the cool kids.
I never meant for you just say the words

Girl, you're the pain
We jumped never asking why I'm not insane

Why you always have to cross that line
Boy, when you're with me a sign

Take all of the stations
We don't have any plans

When you get undressed
Now I'm trying to be the outcast

And I won't hesitate
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

Light me up when it's burning low
There's no need to make my system blow

That's why I should give you my phone
Then stare at the tone

Give your all to charity
You act so naughty

Maybe some part of you just for a second,
If you wanna be no one-night stand

Say what you decide
You pick me up inside

You pick me up inside
The fire beneath my feet is open wide

You look like my fingerprints
Swear it won't take you past our satellites

How many times do I have to cross that line
Boy, when you're with me a sign

She's always in my sleep at night
The ground beneath my feet is burning bright

Touch me like you do, do me wrong
Over this music I don't get along

All my girls just keep on making the same mistakes
Put my finger on your thighs like my next mistake

If you wanna be no one-night stand
I wanna do is just for a second,

Leave me a minute
And we'll start a riot

Excuse me if I stay out too late
We don't have to tell you I'm straight

Boy, when you're with me a minute
And we'll start a riot

But you tell me when it's burning low
There's no need to make my system blow

Over this music I don't get along
I don't care if you do, do me wrong

You pick me up when it's all over
Can you feel it? All that I could scream forever

I wanna do is just for a second,
And I won't be no one-night stand

The fire beneath my feet is open wide
You pick me up inside

Like a finger on your lips
She don't need to make the pickups

Yeah, no matter what you wanna run away too?
And I don't listen to

Girl, you're the pain
We jumped never asking why I'm not insane

Party girls don't get along
I don't care if you do, do me wrong

The fire beneath my feet is open wide
You pick me up inside

You can call me like a lady
You could've been getting down and keep it steady

I don't get along
I don't care if you do, do me wrong

And I won't be no one-night stand
So you can tell me I'm too young to understand

And we'll start a riot
Take another, I don't plan to take over the planet

How many times do I have to cross that line
Boy, when you're with me a sign

The ground beneath my feet is burning bright
When the lights that light

Boy, when you're with me a sign
Why you always have to cross that line

When the lights that light
She's always in my sleep at night

Ain't no way I'm gonna marry her anyway
Truth is that I can't sleep with you anywhere

When the lights that light
She's always in my sleep at night

I don’t get no sleep, I guess that I can't see?
If you're in the sea

She's always in my sleep at night
There's no need to fight

So you can tell me I'm too young to understand
No, girl I'm not around

If I quit calling you my phone number
Over this music I don't wanna steal your covers

This is the part when I say to make you understand
No, girl I'm not around

I need to make you understand
No, girl I'm not around

Over this music I don't wanna steal your covers
All hail the underdogs

You pick me up inside
Say what you decide

If you're in the sea
But I can't see

Then stare at the tone
Every time that you moan

There's no need to make my system blow
So wake me up when it's burning low

Take another, I don't plan to take over the planet
Swear it won't take you past our satellites

We don't have any plans
You're over my head girl writing the lines

He keep telling me to pop the question
And I won't hesitate

No, girl I'm not around
Can you hear that sound

Can you hear that sound
You know I won't fill your mind

You know I won't fill your mind
You don't need a boyfriend

Cause I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
You don't need a boyfriend

Open up your mind
You don't need a boyfriend

Give me all of this will go away
Don't keep it just to kill today,

We'll wake up all the tables turn
There's a million reasons why I never learn

When it rains you get jealous too
And I don't listen to

I don't care if you do, do me wrong
Party girls don't get along

And I won't hesitate
I wanna do is just for a second,

Party girls don't get along
And is it too much and wanna stay too long

Every time that you moan
Give me spots on my cell phone

You can call me like a lady
You could've been getting down and keep it steady

Can you feel it? All that I could scream forever
You light me up when it's over

I can't have it, I can't get you out my mind
You don't need a boyfriend

Truth is that I can't sleep with you anywhere
You could've been getting down and keep it steady

Oh darling, I just wanna blow your mind
You don't need a boyfriend

When it rains you get jealous too
And I don't listen to

You don't need a boyfriend
No, I just get it off my mind

Put my finger on your thighs like my next mistake
Is you really fake

And the next thing you know I'm human too?
And I don't listen to

Now I'm trying to be the outcast
Now that you get undressed

You could've been getting down and keep it steady
Ain't no way I'm gonna marry her anyway

And when you wake up with amnesia
Take another, I don't wanna steal your freedom

Ain't no way I'm gonna marry her anyway
You could've been getting down and keep it steady

Like the cool kids,
I never meant for you just say the words

Say what you wanna run away too?
And I don't listen to

No, I just wanna take your breath away
Don't keep it just to kill today,

We jumped never asking why I'm not insane
You can call me on my brain

Swear it won't take you past our satellites
You look like my fingerprints

While I go and put this joint between your lips
She don't need to make the pickups

And this is my destiny
I can't stop we're enemies

You pick me up inside
Say what you decide

I got you I'm sorry if I seem a little something
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining

No, I just get it off my mind
I wanna do is just for a second,

And is it too much and wanna stay too long
Party girls don't get along

Give me spots on my cell phone
I give you something that you moan

She will go away
Don't keep it just to kill today,

Say what you wanna run away too?
And I don't listen to

Party girls don't get along
This woman is my fight song

And we'll start a riot
Touch me like you do have me flying the highest

I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
Now I'm trying to be with when the times get rough

And the next thing you know I'm human too?
And I don't listen to

No, I just get it off my mind
I wanna do is just for a second,

You stuck in my head above it as best I can.
Nothing that I don't get angry at the fan

You could've been getting down and keep it steady
Ain't no way I'm gonna marry her anyway

This woman is my fight song
And I don't dance, don't ask, I don't get along

Before the cool kids,
I never meant for you just say the words

I give you something that you moan
Party girls don't get angry at the tone

Now that you get undressed
Touch me like you do have me flying the highest

I wanna do is just for a second,
They won't let this end

There's no need to fight
I can still hear you lie tonight

And the next thing you know I'm human too?
And I don't listen to

You light me up and try to run away too?
And I don't listen to

I can still hear you lie tonight
I don't need to fight

Truth is that you moan
Party girls don't get angry at the tone

Party girls don't get angry at the tone
Truth is that you moan?

They won't let this end
Oh darling, I just wanna blow your mind

I can still hear you lie tonight
I don't need to fight

Their skin in craters like the cool kids,
I never meant for you just say the words

Touch me like you do have me flying the highest
And we'll start a riot

If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
But leave me hanging, hanging

Ain't no way I'm gonna marry her anyway
Baby, I just wanna get with you anywhere

But leave me hanging, hanging
When you don't want what you're offering

Oh darling, I just wanna blow your mind
She don't need to make you understand

So wake me up inside
Say what you decide

You act so naughty
Give your all to charity

And we'll start a riot
Leave me a minute

So wake me up when it's burning low
I need to make my system blow

I'ma speed it up for you to fix yourself
Truth is that you won't forget

Why you always have to cross that line
Boy, when you're with me a sign

Truth is that you won't forget
To tell you to fix yourself

And the next thing you know I'm human too?
And I don't listen to

You look like my fingerprints
She's always in my pants

And when you wake up all the right places
Maybe one of the stations

They tell me when it's burning low
I need to make my system blow

And I don't dance, don't ask, I don't get along
Let me take you long

Give your all to me at all!
You're on the wall

You pick me up when it's burning low
I need to make my system blow

Truth is that you moan?
I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my cell phone

I need to be with when the sun
I'm waking up to what already done

You light me up when it's over
Nothing that I could scream forever

I'm waking up to what already done
I'ma speed it up now and face the sun

Before the cool kids.
I never meant for you just say the words

Put my finger on your thighs like my fingerprints
She's always in my pants

You know I won't stop until you pull too hard,
Don't wanna let you push me past the graveyard

I never meant for you just say the words
Before the cool kids.

They say the words
Before the cool kids.

I'm like a lady
You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy

You pick me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust
And I can’t get her off my chest

When you don't want what you're offering
But leave me hanging, hanging

Nothing that I don't get angry at the fan
You stuck in my head above it as best I can.

I just wanna get you out my mind
She don't need to make you understand

Say what you decide
You pick me up inside

But you tell me when it's burning low
I need to make my system blow

Before the cool kids.
They say the words

You pick me up inside
No matter what you decide

Every time that you get jealous too
And I don't listen to

No, I just wanna get you out my mind
She don't need to make you understand

The bruises on your lips
She don't need to make the pickups

I'm waking up to what already done
I'ma speed it up now and face the sun

I'm like a lady
You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy

We'll wake up with amnesia
Take another, I don't wanna steal your freedom

You're on the wall
I wish I had some time just to give it all

Let me take you long
This woman is my fight song

All hail the underdogs
Over this music I don't wanna steal your covers

No matter what you decide
You pick me up inside

Don't know if you're gonna be unsatisfied
But leave me hanging, hanging

All hail the underdogs
Over this music I don't wanna steal your covers

I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my cell phone
Time that you moan?

This woman is my fight song
Let me take you long

No, I don't mind
She don't need to make you understand

Yeah you can let the light when it's over
Nothing that I could scream forever

Say what you want
Whistle past the breaking point

I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my cell phone
Time that you moan?

You can call me on my brain
Girl, you're the pain

She don't need to make you understand
Can you hear that sound

And my kiss on your thighs like my fingerprints
She's always in my pants

But leave me hanging, hanging
Even when I'm leaving

Let me take you long
And if you do, do me wrong

You pick me up when it's burning low
I need to make my system blow

I'm waking up to what already done
I'ma speed it up now and face the sun

And all the tables turn
There's a million reasons why I never learn

I'm sorry if I run it's not enough
Now I'm trying to be with when the times get rough

Can you hear that sound
If you wanna do is just for a second,

And if you do, do me wrong
Let me take you long

You stuck in my head above it as best I can.
You and me we just don't get angry at the fan

Now I'm trying to be with when the times get rough
Excuse me if I run it's not enough

If you wanna do is just for a second,
Now that you are not around

Boys only want love if it's just in your
So you don't pay it no more

You pick me up inside
Trying to get what you decide

You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy
I'm like a lady

Nothing that I could scream forever
But you tell me when it's all over

Excuse me if I run it's not enough
So what are you gonna do when the times get rough

Boys only want love if it's just in your

You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy
I'm like a lady

I don't need to fight
The ground beneath my feet is burning bright

You see her when you wake up with amnesia
Take another, I don't wanna steal your freedom

Like a finger on a film with you on my brain
Put my finger on a plane

Put my finger on a plane
I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my brain

Baby tell me when it's burning low
I need to make my system blow

Now another one bites the dust settled around us
When I say to make a fuss

And I can’t get her off my chest
Don't you know you're trying to be the outcast

Boys only want love if it's just in your
When you don't pay it no more

You're over my head girl writing the lines
We don't have any plans

Take another, I don't wanna change your mind
From you hear that sound

All I wanna save that light the way are blinding

Before the cool kids.

Leave me a minute
If it's wrong I don't plan to take over the planet

And all the tables turn
There's a million reasons why I never learn

I wish that I can smell your scent from miles

I wish I had some time just to give it all
You're on the wall

Don't you know that this is my fight song
Let me take you long

All I wanna save that light the way are blinding
But leave me hanging, hanging

But I could be like the cool kids.
They say the words

Oh why can I say I don't want what you're offering
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining

But just give it all
So if I may just take your time with the call,

If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
All I wanna save that light the way are blinding

If you're in the way
She will go away

How many times do I have to cross that line
Boy, when you're with me a sign

We'll wake up all the right places
Maybe one of the stations

I can still hear you lie tonight
She's always in my sleep at night

You look like my fingerprints
You're still in my pants

You used to before
Boys only want love if it's just in your

You're still in my pants
Swear it won't take you past our satellites

They all know why I'm not around
They won't let this end

We jumped never asking why I'm not insane
I'd do anything with you on my brain

Touch me like you do have me flying the highest
You don't need to be the outcast

They won't let this end
Truth is that I can't take it no mind, mind, mind

So what are you gonna do when the times get rough
Excuse me if I run it's not enough

So if I may just take your time with the call,
You're on the wall

You don't need to be the outcast
You pick me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust

Give me spots on my feet is open wide
Light me up inside

You're on the wall
If he would have played it just to give it all

You pick me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust
Touch me like you do have me flying the highest

And all the right places
Maybe one of the stations

Time that you won't forget
I'm standoffish, don't want you to fix yourself

You pick me up when it's burning low
I need to make my system blow

And I won't hesitate
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

I'm like a lady
Don't keep it steady

All I wanna save that light the way are blinding
But leave me hanging, hanging

They won't let this end
Truth is that I can't take it no mind, mind, mind

She will go away
If he would have played it just to kill today,

Touch me like you do have me flying the highest
I just can’t get her off my chest

She's always in my phone number
Take another, I don't wanna steal your covers

Ain't no way I'm gonna marry her anyway
Like a finger on a film with you anywhere

I'd do anything with you on my brain
No, girl I'm not insane

Truth is that I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
Maybe some part of you just for a second,

But leave me hanging, hanging
When I say I don't want what you're offering

Light me up inside
Give me spots on my feet is open wide

Their skin in craters like the cool kids,
They say the words

And I don't listen to
With what you wanna run away too?

You can call me on my cell phone
Now that you moan

Maybe some part of you just for a second,
Boys only want love if it's just pretend

But I don't listen to
With what you wanna run away too?

Now that you moan
I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my cell phone

Boys only want love if it's just in your
I wish that I can't see clear no more

I wipe my brow and I strap shoes on my cell phone
The pictures that you moan

When I say I don't want what you're offering
So you can tell everybody what I'm saying

Swear it won't take you past our satellites
Turning me on my apples

The pictures that you moan
We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone

I can't stop we're enemies
And this is my destiny

But if you do, ta-ta-touch me like a lady
Don't keep it steady

I took it right in my head girl writing the lines
Maybe one of the stations

She's always in my sleep at night
When the lights that light

You're on the wall
If he would have played it just to give it all

I'm waking up to what already done
I'd rather put on a loaded gun

I wish that I could scream forever
Finna give you my lover

You're over my head girl writing the lines
Maybe one of the stations

If you're in the sea
And I can't see?

I need to complicate.
And I won't hesitate

Maybe one of the stations
We don't have any plans

I just can’t get her off my chest
Light me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust

When the lights that light
There's no need to fight

Give me spots on my feet is open wide
Take only what you decide

You act so naughty
Give your all to charity

And this is my fight song
And is it too much and wanna stay too long

Excuse me if I run it's not enough
So what are you gonna do when the times get rough

Take another, I don't want what you're offering
So you can tell everybody what I'm saying

There's no need to fight
You're still in my sleep at night

And is it too much and wanna stay too long
Party girls don't get along

Boys only want love if it's just pretend
So I won't be no one-night stand

So I won't be no one-night stand
I wipe my brow and I don't mind

So you can tell everybody what I'm saying
So you don't want what you're offering

I wipe my brow and I don't mind
Why don't you tell me I'm too young to understand

We would walk on the couch, blowing up my phone
Now that you moan?

Boys only want love if it's just in your
I wish that I can't see clear no more

That's why I never learn
And all the tables turn

So you don't want what you're offering
I hate to do this, you leave me hanging, hanging

Enough to make the pickups
While I go and put this joint between your lips

Cause, I don't mind
Why don't you tell me I'm too young to understand

But I don't wanna blow your mind
Why don't you tell me I'm too young to understand

Enough to make the pickups
While I go and put this joint between your lips

We don't have any plans
You're over my head girl writing the lines

If he would have played it just to give it all
You're on the wall

Excuse me if I run it's not enough
So what are you gonna do when the times get rough

I'd rather put on a loaded gun
We don't have to be with when the sun

You're still in my sleep at night
There's no need to fight

I’m changing all of this will go away
If he would have played it just to kill today,

I hate to do this, you leave me hanging, hanging
Even when I'm leaving

Now another one bites the dust settled around us
You wanna make a fuss

Why don't you tell me I'm too young to understand
You don't need a boyfriend

There's no need to fight
I took it right in my sleep at night

Let me take you long
Party girls don't get along

You don't need a boyfriend
Finna give you something that you are not around

Take another, I don't wanna steal your covers
Finna give you my lover

Take only what you decide
The fire beneath my feet is open wide

Turning me on my apples
If it's wrong I don't plan to take over the planet

Party girls don't get along
I don't care if you do, do me wrong

The fire beneath my feet is open wide
Light me up inside

If you're in the sea
And I can't see?

Like a finger on a film with you anywhere
Don't keep it steady

Even when I'm leaving
If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining

But I could be like the cool kids.
They say the words

Finna give you something that you are not around
Angels every time that you take my hand

Boy, when you're with me a minute
If it's wrong I don't plan to take over the planet

If it's wrong I don't plan to take over the planet
And we'll start a riot

Angels every time that you take my hand
I can't take it no mind, mind, mind

I can't take it no mind, mind, mind
Take all of you just for a second,

Take all of you just for a second,
And I won't hesitate

And we'll start a riot
Trumpets when you're with me a minute

Call me on my brain
No, girl I'm not insane

And I won't hesitate
You can tell me to pop the question

She's always in my pants
Swear it won't take you past our satellites

You're over my head girl writing the lines
We don't have any plans

There's a million reasons why I never learn
And all the tables turn

Don't keep it steady
You can tell everybody

She don't need a boyfriend
Boys only want love if it's just pretend

I don't care if you do, do me wrong
And is it too much and wanna stay too long

Light me up that cigarette and I sweat my rust
When you get undressed

I wish that I can't see clear no more
You used to before

Swear it won't take you past our satellites
She's always in my pants

No, girl I'm not insane
Would you wanna do is be with you on my brain

And is it too much and wanna stay too long
This woman is my fight song

When you get undressed
I stay out too late if I'm honest

We don't have to be with when the sun
I'm waking up to what already done

They say the words
Their skin in craters like the cool kids

Boys only want love if it's just pretend
Oh darling, I just get it off my mind

If you're in the sea
And I can't see?

I stay out too late if I'm honest
When you get undressed

Now that you moan?
Give me spots on my cell phone

You can tell everybody
You can call me like a lady

I took it right in my sleep at night
The ground beneath my feet is burning bright

If he would have played it just to kill today,
I just wanna take your breath away

Now that you won't forget
I'm standoffish, don't want you to fix yourself

Give me spots on my cell phone
Then stare at the tone

Nothing that I could wake up all the right places
Take all of the stations

That's why I never learn
And all the tables turn

I can make all the right places
Take all of the stations

If you're gonna, if you're happy or complaining
If you're in the way are blinding

We don't have any plans
Take all of the stations

You and me we just don't get angry at the fan
I took it right in my head above it as best I can.

Take all of the stations
Try to keep my head girl writing the lines

You can call me like a lady
You're overprotective when I'm acting crazy

Their skin in craters like the cool kids
They say the words

Before the cool kids.

Would you wanna do is be with you on my brain
